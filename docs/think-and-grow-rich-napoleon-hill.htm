<P class="p10 ft1">—</P>
<P class="p11 ft10">IN EVERY chapter of this book, mention has been made of the <NOBR>money-making</NOBR> secret which has made fortunes for more than ﬁve hundred exceedingly wealthy men whom I have carefully analyzed over a long period of years.</P>
<P class="p12 ft10">The secret was brought to my attention by Andrew Carnegie, more than a quarter of a century ago. The canny, lovable old Scotsman carelessly tossed it into my mind, when I was but a boy. Then he sat back in his chair, with a merry twinkle in his eyes, and watched carefully to see if I had brains enough to understand the full signiﬁcance of what he had said to me.</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">When he saw that I had grasped the idea, he asked if I would be willing to spend twenty years or more, preparing myself to take it to the world, to men and women who, without the secret, might go through life as failures. I said I would, and with Mr. Carnegie’s cooperation, I have kept my promise.</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">This book contains the secret, after having been put to a practical test by thou- sands of people, in almost every walk of life. It was Mr. Carnegie’s idea that the magic formula, which gave him a stupendous fortune, ought to be placed within reach of people who do not have time to investigate how men make money, and it was his hope that I might test and demonstrate the soundness of the formula through the experience of men and women in every calling.</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">He believed the formula should be taught in all public schools and colleges, and expressed the opinion that if it were properly taught it would so revolutionize the entire educational system that the time spent in school could be reduced to less than half.</P>
<P class="p14 ft10">His experience with Charles M. Schwab, and other young men of Mr. Schwab’s type, convinced Mr. Carnegie that much of that which is taught in the schools is of no value whatsoever in connection with the business of earning a living or ac- cumulating riches. He had arrived at this decision, because he had taken into his business one young man after another, many of them with but little schooling, and by coaching them in the use of this formula, developed in them rare leader- ship. Moreover, his coaching made fortunes for everyone of them who followed his instructions. In the chapter on Faith, you will read the astounding story of the organization of the giant United States Steel Corporation, as it was conceived and carried out by one of the young men through whom Mr. Carnegie proved that</P>

<P class="p15 ft10">his formula will work for all who are ready for it. This single application of the secret, by that young <NOBR>man-Charles</NOBR> M. <NOBR>Schwab-made</NOBR> him a huge fortune in both money and OPPORTUNITY. Roughly speaking, this particular application of the formula was worth six hundred million dollars. These <NOBR>facts-and</NOBR> they are facts well known to almost everyone who knew Mr. <NOBR>Carnegie-give</NOBR> you a fair idea of what the reading of this book may bring to you, provided you KNOW WHAT IT IS THAT YOU WANT.</P>
<P class="p16 ft10">Even before it had undergone twenty years of practical testing, the secret was passed on to more than one hundred thousand men and women who have used it for their personal beneﬁt, as Mr. Carnegie planned that they should. Some have made fortunes with it. Others have used it successfully in creating harmony in their homes. A clergyman used it so effectively that it brought him an income of upwards of $75,000.00 a year.</P>
<P class="p17 ft10">Arthur Nash, a Cincinnati tailor, used his <NOBR>near-bankrupt</NOBR> business as a “guinea pig” on which to test the formula. The business came to life and made a fortune for its owners. It is still thriving, although Mr. Nash has gone. The experiment was so unique that newspapers and magazines, gave it more than a million dol- lars’ worth of laudatory publicity.</P>
<P class="p17 ft10">The secret was passed on to Stuart Austin Wier, of Dallas, Texas. He was ready for <NOBR>it-so</NOBR> ready that he gave up his profession and studied law. Did he succeed? That story is told too.</P>
<P class="p17 ft10">I gave the secret to Jennings Randolph, the day he graduated from College, and he has used it so successfully that he is now serving his third term as a Member of Congress, with an excellent opportunity to keep on using it until it carries him to the White House.</P>
<P class="p18 ft10">While serving as Advertising Manager of the <NOBR>La-Salle</NOBR> Extension University, when it was little more than a name, I had the privilege of seeing J. G. Chapline, Presi- dent of the University, use the formula so effectively that he has since made the LaSalle one of the great extension schools of the country.</P>
<P class="p17 ft10">The secret to which I refer has been mentioned no fewer than a hundred times, throughout this book. It has not been directly named, for it seems to work more successfully when it is merely uncovered and left in sight, where THOSE WHO ARE READY, and SEARCHING FOR IT, may pick it up. That is why Mr. Carnegie tossed it to me so quietly, without giving me its speciﬁc name.</P>

<P class="p19 ft10">If you are READY to put it to use, you will recognize this secret at least once in every chapter. I wish I might feel privileged to tell you how you will know if you are ready, but that would deprive you of much of the beneﬁt you will receive when you make the discovery in your own way.</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">While this book was being written, my own son, who was then ﬁnishing the last year of his college work, picked up the manuscript of chapter two, read it, and dis- covered the secret for himself. He used the information so effectively that he went directly into a responsible position at a beginning salary greater than the average man ever earns. His story has been brieﬂy described in chapter two.</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">When you read it, perhaps you will dismiss any feeling you may have had, at the beginning of the book, that it promised too much. And, too, if you have ever been discouraged, if you have had difﬁculties to surmount which took the very soul out of you, if you have tried and failed, if you were ever handicapped by illness or physical afﬂiction, this story of my son’s discovery and use of the Carnegie formula may prove to be the oasis in the Desert of Lost Hope, for which you have been searching.</P>
<P class="p20 ft10">This secret was extensively used by President Woodrow Wilson, during the World War. It was passed on to every soldier who fought in the war, carefully wrapped in the training received before going to the front. President Wilson told me it was a strong factor in raising the funds needed for the war.</P>
<P class="p12 ft10">More than twenty years ago, Hon. Manuel L. Quezon (then Resident Commis- sioner of the Philippine Islands), was inspired by the secret to gain freedom for his people. He has gained freedom for the Philippines, and is the ﬁrst President of the free state. A peculiar thing about this secret is that those who once acquire it and use it, ﬁnd themselves literally swept on to success, with but little effort, and they never again submit to failure! If you doubt this, study the names of those who have used it, wherever they have been mentioned, check their records for yourself, and be convinced.</P>
<P class="p21 ft8">There is no such thing as SOMETHING FOR NOTHING!</P>
<P class="p22 ft11">The secret to which I refer cannot be had without a price, although the price is far less than its value. It cannot be had at any price by those who are not intentionally searching for it. It cannot be given away, it cannot be purchased for money, for the reason that it comes in two parts. One part is already in possession of those who are ready for it. The secret serves equally well, all who are ready for it.</P>

<P class="p15 ft10">Education has nothing to do with it. Long before I was born, the secret had found its way into the possession of Thomas A. Edison, and he used it so intelligently that he became the world’s leading inventor, although he had but three months of schooling. The secret was passed on to a business associate of Mr. Edison. He used it so effectively that, although he was then making only $12,000 a year, he accumulated a great fortune, and retired from active business while still a young man. You will ﬁnd his story at the beginning of the ﬁrst chapter. It should con- vince you that riches are not beyond your reach, that you can still be what you wish to be, that money, fame, recognition and happiness can be had by all who are ready and determined to have these blessings.</P>
<P class="p23 ft12">How do I know these things? You should have the answer before you ﬁnish this book. You may ﬁnd it in the very ﬁrst chapter, or on the last page.</P>
<P class="p16 ft10">While I was performing the twenty year task of research, which I had undertak- en at Mr. Carnegie’s request, I analyzed hundreds of well known men, many of whom admitted that they had accumulated their vast fortunes through the aid of the Carnegie secret; among these men were: -</P>

<P class="p15 ft10">These names represent but a small fraction of the hundreds of well known Ameri- cans whose achievements, ﬁnancially and otherwise, prove that those who un- derstand and apply the Carnegie secret, reach high stations in life. I have never known anyone who was inspired to use the secret, who did not achieve notewor- thy success in his chosen calling. I have never known any person to distinguish himself, or to accumulate riches of any consequence, without possession of the secret.</P>
<P class="p16 ft10">From these two facts I draw the conclusion that the secret is more important, as a part of the knowledge essential for <NOBR>self-determination,</NOBR> than any which one re- ceives through what is popularly known as “education.”</P>
<P class="p18 ft10">What is EDUCATION, anyway? This has been answered in full detail. As far as schooling is concerned, many of these men had very little. John Wanamaker once told me that what little schooling he had, he acquired in very much the same manner as a modern locomotive takes on water, by “scooping it up as it runs.” Henry Ford never reached high school, let alone college. I am not attempting to minimize the value of schooling, but I am trying to express my earnest belief that those who master and apply the secret will reach high stations, accumulate riches, and bargain with life on their own terms, even if their schooling has been meager.</P>
<P class="p23 ft10">Somewhere, as you read, the secret to which I refer will jump from the page and stand boldly before you, IF YOU ARE READY FOR IT! When it appears, you will recognize it. Whether you receive the sign in the ﬁrst or the last chapter, stop for a moment when it presents itself, and turn down a glass, for that occasion will mark the most important <NOBR>turning-point</NOBR> of your life.</P>
<P class="p17 ft10">We pass now, to Chapter One, and to the story of my very dear friend, who has gen- erously acknowledged having seen the mystic sign, and whose business achieve- ments are evidence enough that he turned down a glass. As you read his story, and the others, remember that they deal with the important problems of life, such as all men experience. The problems arising from one’s endeavor to earn a living, to ﬁnd hope, courage, contentment and peace of mind; to accumulate riches and to enjoy freedom of body and spirit.</P>
<P class="p17 ft10">Remember, too, as you go through the book, that it deals with facts and not with ﬁction, its purpose being to convey a great universal truth through which all who are READY may learn, not only WHAT TO DO, BUT ALSO HOW TO DO IT! and receive, as well, THE NEEDED STIMULUS TO MAKE A START.</P>

<P class="p32 ft15">THE MAN WHO “THOUGHT” HIS WAY INTO PARTNERSHIP WITH THOMAS A. EDISON</P>
<P class="p12 ft10">TRULY, “thoughts are things,” and powerful things at that, when they are mixed with deﬁniteness of purpose, persistence, and a BURNING DESIRE for their translation into riches, or other material objects.</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">A little more than thirty years ago, Edwin C. Barnes discovered how true it is that men really do THINK AND GROW RICH. His discovery did not come about at one sitting. It came little by little, beginning with a BURNING DESIRE to become a business associate of the great Edison.</P>
<P class="p12 ft10">One of the chief characteristics of Barnes’ Desire was that it was deﬁnite. He wanted to work with Edison, not for him. Observe, carefully, the description of how he went about translating his DESIRE into reality, and you will have a better understanding of the thirteen principles which lead to riches. When this DESIRE, or impulse of thought, ﬁrst ﬂashed into his mind he was in no position to act upon it. Two difﬁculties stood in his way. He did not know Mr. Edison, and he did not have enough money to pay his railroad fare to Orange, New Jersey. These difﬁ- culties were sufﬁcient to have discouraged the majority of men from making any attempt to carry out the desire.</P>
<P class="p33 ft10">But his was no ordinary desire! He was so determined to ﬁnd a way to carry out his desire that he ﬁnally decided to travel by “blind baggage,” rather than be de- feated. (To the uninitiated, this means that he went to East Orange on a freight train). He presented himself at Mr. Edison’s laboratory, and announced he had come to go into business with the inventor. In speaking of the ﬁrst meeting be- tween Barnes and Edison, years later, Mr. Edison said, “He stood there before me, looking like an ordinary tramp, but there was something in the expression of his face which conveyed the impression that he was determined to get what he had come after. I had learned, from years of experience with men, that when a man really DESIRES a thing so deeply that he is willing to stake his entire future on a single turn of the wheel in order to get it, he is sure to win. I gave him the op- portunity he asked for, because I saw he had made up his mind to stand by until he succeeded. Subsequent events proved that no mistake was made.”</P>

<P class="p34 ft10">Just what young Barnes said to Mr. Edison on that occasion was far less impor- tant than that which he thought. Edison, himself, said so! It could not have been the young man’s appearance which got him his start in the Edison ofﬁce, for that was deﬁnitely against him. It was what he THOUGHT that counted. If the sig- niﬁcance of this statement could be conveyed to every person who reads it, there would be no need for the remainder of this book.</P>
<P class="p35 ft10">Barnes did not get his partnership with Edison on his ﬁrst interview. He did get a chance to work in the Edison ofﬁces, at a very nominal wage, doing work that was unimportant to Edison, but most important to Barnes, because it gave him an opportunity to display his “merchandise” where his intended “partner” could see it. Months went by. Apparently nothing happened to bring the coveted goal which Barnes had set up in his mind as his DEFINITE MAJOR PURPOSE. But something important was happening in Barnes’ mind. He was constantly intensi- fying his DESIRE to become the business associate of Edison.</P>
<P class="p35 ft10">Psychologists have correctly said that “when one is truly ready for a thing, it puts in its appearance.” Barnes was ready for a business association with Edison, moreover, he was DETERMINED TO REMAIN READY UNTIL HE GOT THAT WHICH HE WAS SEEKING.</P>
<P class="p36 ft10">He did not say to himself, “Ah well, what’s the use? I guess I’ll change my mind and try for a salesman’s job.” But, he did say, “I came here to go into business with Edison, and I’ll accomplish this end if it takes the remainder of my life.” He meant it! What a different story men would have to tell if only they would adopt a DEFINITE PURPOSE, and stand by that purpose until it had time to become an <NOBR>all-consuming</NOBR> obsession!</P>
<P class="p35 ft10">Maybe young Barnes did not know it at the time, but his bulldog determination, his persistence in standing back of a single DESIRE, was destined to mow down all opposition, and bring him the opportunity he was seeking.</P>
<P class="p18 ft11">When the opportunity came, it appeared in a different form, and from a different direction than Barnes had expected. That is one of the tricks of opportunity. It has a sly habit of slipping in by the back door, and often it comes disguised in the form of misfortune, or temporary defeat. Perhaps this is why so many fail to recognize opportunity. Mr. Edison had just perfected a new ofﬁce device, known at that time, as the Edison Dictating Machine (now the Ediphone). His salesmen were not enthusiastic over the machine. They did not believe it could be sold without great effort. Barnes saw his opportunity. It had crawled in quietly, hidden in a queer looking machine which interested no one but Barnes and the inventor.</P>

<P class="p19 ft10">Barnes knew he could sell the Edison Dictating Machine. He suggested this to Edison, and promptly got his chance. He did sell the machine. In fact, he sold it so successfully that Edison gave him a contract to distribute and market it all over the nation. Out of that business association grew the slogan, “Made by Edison and installed by Barnes.”</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">The business alliance has been in operation for more than thirty years. Out of it Barnes has made himself rich in money, but he has done something inﬁnitely greater, he has proved that one really may “Think and Grow Rich.”</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">How much actual cash that original DESIRE of Barnes’ has been worth to him, I have no way of knowing. Perhaps it has brought him two or three million dol- lars, but the amount, whatever it is, becomes insigniﬁcant when compared with the greater asset he acquired in the form of deﬁnite knowledge that an intangible impulse of thought can be transmuted into its physical counterpart by the appli- cation of known principles.</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">Barnes literally thought himself into a partnership with the great Edison! He thought himself into a fortune. He had nothing to start with, except the capacity to KNOW WHAT HE WANTED, AND THE DETERMINATION TO STAND BY THAT DESIRE UNTIL HE REALIZED IT. He had no money to begin with. He had but little education. He had no inﬂuence. But he did have initiative, faith, and the will to win. With these intangible forces he made himself number one man with the greatest inventor who ever lived.</P>
<P class="p20 ft10">Now, let us look at a different situation, and study a man who had plenty of tan- gible evidence of riches, but lost it, because he stopped three feet short of the goal he was seeking.</P>
<P class="p37 ft16">THREE FEET FROM GOLD</P>
<P class="p33 ft10">One of the most common causes of failure is the habit of quitting when one is overtaken by temporary defeat. Every person is guilty of this mistake at one time or another. An uncle of R. U. Darby was caught by the “gold fever” in the gold- rush days, and went west to DIG AND GROW RICH. He had never heard that more gold has been mined from the brains of men than has ever been taken from the earth. He staked a claim and went to work with pick and shovel. The going was hard, but his lust for gold was deﬁnite.</P>

<P class="p15 ft10">retraced his footsteps to his home in Williamsburg, Maryland, told his relatives and a few neighbors of the “strike.” They got together money for the needed ma- chinery, had it shipped. The uncle and Darby went back to work the mine.</P>
<P class="p17 ft10">The ﬁrst car of ore was mined, and shipped to a smelter. The returns proved they had one of the richest mines in Colorado! A few more cars of that ore would clear the debts. Then would come the big killing in proﬁts.</P>
<P class="p18 ft10">Down went the drills! Up went the hopes of Darby and Uncle! Then something happened! The vein of gold ore disappeared! They had come to the end of the rainbow, and the pot of gold was no longer there! They drilled on, desperately trying to pick up the vein <NOBR>again-all</NOBR> to no avail.</P>
<P class="p17 ft10">Finally, they decided to QUIT. They sold the machinery to a junk man for a few hundred dollars, and took the train back home. Some “junk” men are dumb, but not this one! He called in a mining engineer to look at the mine and do a little calculating. The engineer advised that the project had failed, because the owners were not familiar with “fault lines.” His calculations showed that the vein would be found JUST THREE FEET FROM WHERE THE DARBYS HAD STOPPED DRILLING! That is exactly where it was found!</P>
<P class="p17 ft10">The “Junk” man took millions of dollars in ore from the mine, because he knew enough to seek expert counsel before giving up. Most of the money which went into the machinery was procured through the efforts of R. U. Darby, who was then a very young man. The money came from his relatives and neighbors, be- cause of their faith in him. He paid back every dollar of it, although he was years in doing so.</P>
<P class="p16 ft10">Long afterward, Mr. Darby recouped his loss many times over, when he made the discovery that DESIRE can be transmuted into gold. The discovery came after he went into the business of selling life insurance.</P>
<P class="p18 ft10">Remembering that he lost a huge fortune, because he STOPPED three feet from gold, Darby proﬁted by the experience in his chosen work, by the simple method of saying to himself, “I stopped three feet from gold, but I will never stop because men say `no’ when I ask them to buy insurance.”</P>
<P class="p17 ft10">Darby is one of a small group of fewer than ﬁfty men who sell more than a mil- lion dollars in life insurance annually. He owes his “stickability” to the lesson he learned from his “quitability” in the gold mining business.</P>

<P class="p39 ft10">Before success comes in any man’s life, he is sure to meet with much temporary defeat, and, perhaps, some failure. When defeat overtakes a man, the easiest and most logical thing to do is to QUIT. That is exactly what the majority of men do.</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">More than ﬁve hundred of the most successful men this country has ever known, told the author their greatest success came just one step beyond the point at which defeat had overtaken them. Failure is a trickster with a keen sense of irony and cunning.</P>
<P class="p40 ft8">It takes great delight in tripping one when success is almost within reach.</P>
<P class="p41 ft16">A <NOBR>FIFTY-CENT</NOBR> LESSON IN PERSISTENCE</P>
<P class="p42 ft10">Shortly after Mr. Darby received his degree from the “University of Hard Knocks,” and had decided to proﬁt by his experience in the gold mining business, he had the good fortune to be present on an occasion that proved to him that “No” does not necessarily mean no.</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">One afternoon he was helping his uncle grind wheat in an old fashioned mill. The uncle operated a large farm on which a number of colored sharecrop farmers lived. Quietly, the door was opened, and a small colored child, the daughter of a tenant, walked in and took her place near the door.</P>
<P class="p12 ft10">The uncle looked up, saw the child, and barked at her roughly, “what do you want?” Meekly, the child replied, “My mammy say send her ﬁfty cents.” “I’ll not do it,” the uncle retorted, “Now you run on home.” “Yas sah,” the child replied. But she did not move. The uncle went ahead with his work, so busily engaged that he did not pay enough attention to the child to observe that she did not leave. When he looked up and saw her still standing there, he yelled at her, “I told you to go on home! Now go, or I’ll take a switch to you.” The little girl said “yas sah,” but she did not budge an inch. The uncle dropped a sack of grain he was about to pour into the mill hopper, picked up a barrel stave, and started toward the child with an expression on his face that indicated trouble.</P>
<P class="p33 ft10">Darby held his breath. He was certain he was about to witness a murder. He knew his uncle had a ﬁerce temper. He knew that colored children were not supposed to defy white people in that part of the country.</P>
<P class="p12 ft10">When the uncle reached the spot where the child was standing, she quickly stepped forward one step, looked up into his eyes, and screamed at the top of her shrill voice, “MY MAMMY’S GOTTA HAVE THAT FIFTY CENTS!”</P>

<P class="p34 ft10">The uncle stopped, looked at her for a minute, then slowly laid the barrel stave on the ﬂoor, put his hand in his pocket, took out half a dollar, and gave it to her. The child took the money and slowly backed toward the door, never taking her eyes off the man whom she had just conquered.</P>
<P class="p36 ft10">After she had gone, the uncle sat down on a box and looked out the window into space for more than ten minutes. He was pondering, with awe, over the whipping he had just taken. Mr. Darby, too, was doing some thinking. That was the ﬁrst time in all his experience that he had seen a colored child deliberately master an adult white person. How did she do it? What happened to his uncle that caused him to lose his ﬁerceness and become as docile as a lamb? What strange power did this child use that made her master over her superior? These and other simi- lar questions ﬂashed into Darby’s mind, but he did not ﬁnd the answer until years later, when he told me the story.</P>
<P class="p43 ft10">Strangely, the story of this unusual experience was told to the author in the old mill, on the very spot where the uncle took his whipping. Strangely, too, I had devoted nearly a quarter of a century to the study of the power which enabled an ignorant, illiterate colored child to conquer an intelligent man.</P>
<P class="p36 ft10">As we stood there in that musty old mill, Mr. Darby repeated the story of the unu- sual conquest, and ﬁnished by asking, “What can you make of it? What strange power did that child use, that so completely whipped my uncle?”</P>
<P class="p44 ft10">The answer to his question will be found in the principles described in this book. The answer is full and complete. It contains details and instructions sufﬁcient to enable anyone to understand, and apply the same force which the little child ac- cidentally stumbled upon.</P>
<P class="p18 ft11">Keep your mind alert, and you will observe exactly what strange power came to the rescue of the child, you will catch a glimpse of this power in the next chapter. Somewhere in the book you will ﬁnd an idea that will quicken your receptive powers, and place at your command, for your own beneﬁt, this same irresistible power. The awareness of this power may come to you in the ﬁrst chapter, or it may ﬂash into your mind in some subsequent chapter. It may come in the form of a single idea. Or, it may come in the nature of a plan, or a purpose. Again, it may cause you to go back into your past experiences of failure or defeat, and bring to the surface some lesson by which you can regain all that you lost through defeat.</P>
<P class="p23 ft17">After I had described to Mr. Darby the power unwittingly used by the little colored child, he quickly retraced his thirty years of experience as a life insurance sales-</P>

<P class="p34 ft10">man, and frankly acknowledged that his success in that ﬁeld was due, in no small degree, to the lesson he had learned from the child.</P>
<P class="p36 ft10">Mr. Darby pointed out: “every time a prospect tried to bow me out, without buy- ing, I saw that child standing there in the old mill, her big eyes glaring in deﬁance, and I said to myself, `I’ve gotta make this sale.’ The better portion of all sales I have made, were made after people had said `NO’.”</P>
<P class="p44 ft10">He recalled, too, his mistake in having stopped only three feet from gold, “but,” he said, “that experience was a blessing in disguise. It taught me to keep on keep- ing on, no matter how hard the going may be, a lesson I needed to learn before I could succeed in anything.”</P>
<P class="p44 ft10">This story of Mr. Darby and his uncle, the colored child and the gold mine, doubt- less will be read by hundreds of men who make their living by selling life insur- ance, and to all of these, the author wishes to offer the suggestion that Darby owes to these two experiences his ability to sell more than a million dollars of life insurance every year.</P>
<P class="p44 ft10">Life is strange, and often imponderable! Both the successes and the failures have their roots in simple experiences. Mr. Darby’s experiences were commonplace and simple enough, yet they held the answer to his destiny in life, therefore they were as important (to him) as life itself. He proﬁted by these two dramatic experi- ences, because he analyzed them, and found the lesson they taught. But what of the man who has neither the time, nor the inclination to study failure in search of knowledge that may lead to success?</P>
<P class="p44 ft10">Where, and how is he to learn the art of converting defeat into stepping stones to opportunity?</P>
<P class="p36 ft10">In answer to these questions, this book was written. The answer called for a de- scription of thirteen principles, but remember, as you read, the answer you may be seeking, to the questions which have caused you to ponder over the strange- ness of life, may be found in your own mind, through some idea, plan, or purpose which may spring into your mind as you read.</P>
<P class="p44 ft10">One sound idea is all that one needs to achieve success. The principles described in this book, contain the best, and the most practical of all that is known, concern- ing ways and means of creating useful ideas.</P>
<P class="p17 ft17">Before we go any further in our approach to the description of these principles, we believe you are entitled to receive this important suggestion....WHEN RICHES</P>

<P class="p34 ft10">BEGIN TO COME THEY COME SO QUICKLY, IN SUCH GREAT ABUNDANCE, THAT ONE WONDERS WHERE THEY HAVE BEEN HIDING DURING ALL THOSE LEAN YEARS.</P>
<P class="p17 ft12">This is an astounding statement, and all the more so, when we take into consider- ation the popular belief, that riches come only to those who work hard and long.</P>
<P class="p35 ft10">When you begin to THINK AND GROW RICH, you will observe that riches begin with a state of mind, with deﬁniteness of purpose, with little or no hard work. You, and every other person, ought to be interested in knowing how to acquire that state of mind which will attract riches. I spent <NOBR>twenty-ﬁve</NOBR> years in research, analyzing more than 25,000 people, because I, too, wanted to know “how wealthy men become that way.</P>
<P class="p44 ft12">Without that research, this book could not have been written. Here take notice of a very signiﬁcant truth, viz:</P>
<P class="p35 ft10">The business depression started in 1929, and continued on to an all time record of destruction, until sometime after President Roosevelt entered ofﬁce. Then the de- pression began to fade into nothingness. Just as an electrician in a theatre raises the lights so gradually that darkness is transmuted into light before you realize it, so did the spell of fear in the minds of the people gradually fade away and become faith.</P>
<P class="p44 ft10">Observe very closely, as soon as you master the principles of this philosophy, and begin to follow the instructions for applying those principles, your ﬁnancial sta- tus will begin to improve, and everything you touch will begin to transmute itself into an asset for your beneﬁt. Impossible? Not at all!</P>
<P class="p44 ft10">One of the main weaknesses of mankind is the average man’s familiarity with the word “impossible.” He knows all the rules which will NOT work. He knows all the things which CANNOT be done. This book was written for those who seek the rules which have made others successful, and are willing to stake everything on those rules. A great many years ago I purchased a ﬁne dictionary. The ﬁrst thing I did with it was to turn to the word “impossible,” and neatly clip it out of the book. That would not be an unwise thing for you to do. Success comes to those who become SUCCESS CONSCIOUS.</P>
<P class="p35 ft12">Failure comes to those who indifferently allow themselves to become FAILURE CONSCIOUS.</P>

<P class="p34 ft10">The object of this book is to help all who seek it, to learn the art of changing their minds from FAILURE CONSCIOUSNESS to SUCCESS CONSCIOUSNESS.</P>
<P class="p36 ft10">Another weakness found in altogether too many people, is the habit of measuring everything, and everyone, by their own impressions and beliefs. Some who will read this, will believe that no one can THINK AND GROW RICH. They cannot think in terms of riches, because their thought habits have been steeped in pov- erty, want, misery, failure, and defeat.</P>
<P class="p44 ft10">These unfortunate people remind me of a prominent Chinese, who came to Amer- ica to be educated in American ways. He attended the University of Chicago. One day President Harper met this young Oriental on the campus, stopped to chat with him for a few minutes, and asked what had impressed him as being the most noticeable characteristic of the American people.</P>
<P class="p17 ft11">“Why,” the Chinaman exclaimed, “the queer slant of your eyes. Your eyes are off slant!” What do we say about the Chinese? We refuse to believe that which we do not understand. We foolishly believe that our own limitations are the proper meas- ure of limitations. Sure, the other fellow’s eyes are “off slant,” BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT THE SAME AS OUR OWN. Millions of people look at the achievements of Henry Ford, after he has arrived, and envy him, because of his good fortune, or luck, or genius, or whatever it is that they credit for Ford’s fortune. Perhaps one person in every hundred thousand knows the secret of Ford’s success, and those who do know are too modest, or too reluctant, to speak of it, because of its sim- plicity. A single transaction will illustrate the “secret” perfectly.</P>
<P class="p43 ft10">A few years back, Ford decided to produce his now famous <NOBR>V-8</NOBR> motor. He chose to build an engine with the entire eight cylinders cast in one block, and instructed his engineers to produce a design for the engine. The design was placed on paper, but the engineers agreed, to a man, that it was simply impossible to cast an eight- cylinder gas engine block in one piece.</P>
<P class="p44 ft10">Ford said, “Produce it anyway.” “But,” they replied, “it’s impossible!” “Go ahead,” Ford commanded, “and stay on the job until you succeed no matter how much time is required.”</P>
<P class="p36 ft10">The engineers went ahead. There was nothing else for them to do, if they were to remain on the Ford staff. Six months went by, nothing happened. Another six months passed, and still nothing happened. The engineers tried every conceiv- able plan to carry out the orders, but the thing seemed out of the question; “im- possible!”</P>

<P class="p19 ft10">At the end of the year Ford checked with his engineers, and again they informed him they had found no way to carry out his orders.</P>
<P class="p12 ft10">“Go right ahead,” said Ford, “I want it, and I’ll have it.” They went ahead, and then, as if by a stroke of magic, the secret was discovered.</P>
<P class="p40 ft8">The Ford DETERMINATION had won once more!</P>
<P class="p33 ft10">This story may not be described with minute accuracy, but the sum and substance of it is correct. Deduce from it, you who wish to THINK AND GROW RICH, the secret of the Ford millions, if you can. You’ll not have to look very far. Henry Ford is a success, because he understands, and applies the principles of success. One of these is DESIRE: knowing what one wants. Remember this Ford story as you read, and pick out the lines in which the secret of his stupendous achievement have been described. If you can do this, if you can lay your ﬁnger on the particular group of principles which made Henry Ford rich, you can equal his achievements in almost any calling for which you are suited.</P>
<P class="p41 ft16">YOU ARE “THE MASTER OF YOUR FATE, THE CAPTAIN OF YOUR</P>
<P class="p27 ft16">SOUL,” BECAUSE...</P>
<P class="p45 ft11">When Henley wrote the prophetic lines, “I am the Master of my Fate, I am the Cap- tain of my Soul,” he should have informed us that we are the Masters of our Fate, the Captains of our Souls, because we have the power to control our thoughts.</P>
<P class="p12 ft10">He should have told us that the ether in which this little earth ﬂoats, in which we move and have our being, is a form of energy moving at an inconceivably high rate of vibration, and that the ether is ﬁlled with a form of universal power which ADAPTS itself to the nature of the thoughts we hold in our minds; and INFLU- ENCES us, in natural ways, to transmute our thoughts into their physical equiva- lent.</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">If the poet had told us of this great truth, we would know WHY IT IS that we are the Masters of our Fate, the Captains of our Souls. He should have told us, with great emphasis, that this power makes no attempt to discriminate between de- structive thoughts and constructive thoughts, that it will urge us to translate into physical reality thoughts of poverty, just as quickly as it will inﬂuence us to act upon thoughts of riches.</P>
<P class="p20 ft12">He should have told us, too, that our brains become magnetized with the domi- nating thoughts which we hold in our minds, and, by means with which no man</P>

<P class="p12 ft10">He should have told us, that before we can accumulate riches in great abundance, we must magnetize our minds with intense DESIRE for riches, that we must be- come “money conscious until the DESIRE for money drives us to create deﬁnite plans for acquiring it.</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">But, being a poet, and not a philosopher, Henley contented himself by stating a great truth in poetic form, leaving those who followed him to interpret the philo- sophical meaning of his lines.</P>
<P class="p12 ft10">Little by little, the truth has unfolded itself, until it now appears certain that the principles described in this book, hold the secret of mastery over our economic fate.</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">We are now ready to examine the ﬁrst of these principles. Maintain a spirit of <NOBR>open-mindedness,</NOBR> and remember as you read, they are the invention of no one man. The principles were gathered from the life experiences of more than 500 men who actually accumulated riches in huge amounts; men who began in pov- erty, with but little education, without inﬂuence. The principles worked for these men. You can put them to work for your own enduring beneﬁt.</P>
<P class="p46 ft8">You will ﬁnd it easy, not hard, to do.</P>
<P class="p33 ft10">Before you read the next chapter, I want you to know that it conveys factual in- formation which might easily change your entire ﬁnancial destiny, as it has so deﬁnitely brought changes of stupendous proportions to two people described.</P>
<P class="p12 ft10">I want you to know, also, that the relationship between these two men and myself, is such that I could have taken no liberties with the facts, even if I had wished to do so. One of them has been my closest personal friend for almost <NOBR>twenty-ﬁve</NOBR> years, the other is my own son. The unusual success of these two men, success which they generously accredit to the principle described in the next chapter, more than justiﬁes this personal reference as a means of emphasizing the far- ﬂung power of this principle.</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">Almost ﬁfteen years ago, I delivered the Commencement Address at Salem Col- lege, Salem, West Virginia. I emphasized the principle described in the next chap- ter, with so much intensity that one of the members of the graduating class deﬁ- nitely appropriated it, and made it a part of his own philosophy. The young man is now a Member of Congress, and an important factor in the present administra-</P>

Just before this book went to the publisher, he wrote me a letter in which he so clearly stated his opinion of the principle outlined in the next chapter, that I have chosen to publish his letter as an introduction to that chapter. It gives you an idea of the rewards to come.</P>
<P class="p47 ft18">“My dear Napoleon:</P>
<P class="p48 ft18">“My service as a Member of Congress having given me an insight into the problems of men and women, I am writing to offer a suggestion which may become helpful to thousands of worthy people.</P>
<P class="p49 ft18">“With apologies, I must state that the suggestion, if acted upon, will mean several years of labor and responsibility for you, but I am <NOBR>en-heartened</NOBR> to make the suggestion, because I know your great love for rendering useful service.</P>
<P class="p50 ft18">“In 1922, you delivered the Commencement address at Salem College, when I was a member’ of the graduating class. In that address, you planted in my mind an idea which has been respon- sible for the opportunity I now have to serve the people of my State, and will be responsible, in a very large measure, for whatever success I may have in the future.</P>
<P class="p51 ft18">“The suggestion I have in mind is, that you put into a book the sum and substance of the address you delivered at Salem College, and in that way give the people of America an opportunity to proﬁt by your many years of experience and association with the men who, by their greatness, have made America the richest nation on earth.</P>
<P class="p52 ft18">“I recall, as though it were yesterday, the marvelous description you gave of the method by which Henry Ford, with but little schooling, without a dollar, with no inﬂuential friends, rose to great heights. I made up my mind then, even before you had ﬁnished your speech, that I would make a place for myself, no matter how many difﬁculties I had to surmount.</P>
<P class="p52 ft19">“Thousands of young people will ﬁnish their schooling this year, and within the next few years. Every one of them will be seeking just such a message of practical encouragement as the one I received from you. They will want to know where to turn, what to do, to get started in life. You can tell them, because you have helped to solve the problems of so many, many people.</P>
<P class="p52 ft19">“If there is any possible way that you can afford to render so great a service, may I offer the suggestion that you include with every book, one of your Personal Analysis Charts, in order that the purchaser of the book may have the beneﬁt of a complete <NOBR>self-inventory,</NOBR> indicating, as you indicated to me years ago, exactly what is standing in the way of success.</P>
<P class="p53 ft18">“Such a service as this, providing the readers of your book with a complete, unbiased picture of their faults and their virtues, would mean to them the difference between success and failure. The service would be priceless.</P>
<P class="p53 ft18">“Millions of people are now facing the problem of staging a <NOBR>come-back,</NOBR> because of the depres- sion, and I speak from personal experience when I say, I know these earnest people would wel- come the opportunity to tell you their problems, and to receive your suggestions for the solu- tion.</P>
<P class="p53 ft18">“You know the problems of those who face the necessity of beginning all over again. There are thousands of people in America today who would like to know how they can convert ideas into money, people who must start at scratch, without ﬁnances, and recoup their losses. If anyone can help them, you can.</P>

<P class="p58 ft10">WHEN Edwin C. Barnes climbed down from the freight train in Orange, N. J., more than thirty years ago, he may have resembled a tramp, but his thoughts were those of a king!</P>
<P class="p12 ft10">As he made his way from the railroad tracks to Thomas A. Edison’s ofﬁce, his mind was at work. He saw himself standing in Edison’s presence. He heard him- self asking Mr. Edison for an opportunity to carry out the one CONSUMING OB- SESSION OF HIS LIFE, a BURNING DESIRE to become the business associate of the great inventor.</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">Barnes’ desire was not a hope! It was not a wish! It was a keen, pulsating DE- SIRE, which transcended everything else. It was DEFINITE.</P>
<P class="p12 ft13">The desire was not new when he approached Edison. It had been Barnes’ domi- nating desire for a long time. In the beginning, when the desire ﬁrst appeared in his mind, it may have been, probably was, only a wish, but it was no mere wish when he appeared before Edison with it.</P>
<P class="p59 ft10">A few years later, Edwin C. Barnes again stood before Edison, in the same ofﬁce where he ﬁrst met the inventor. This time his DESIRE had been translated into reality. He was in business with Edison. The dominating DREAM OF HIS LIFE had become a reality.</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">Today, people who know Barnes envy him, because of the “break” life yielded him. They see him in the days of his triumph, without taking the trouble to inves- tigate the cause of his success.</P>
<P class="p60 ft11">Barnes succeeded because he chose a deﬁnite goal, placed all his energy, all his will power, all his effort, everything back of that goal. He did not become the part- ner of Edison the day he arrived. He was content to start in the most menial work, as long as it provided an opportunity to take even one step toward his cherished goal. Five years passed before the chance he had been seeking made its appear- ance. During all those years not one ray of hope, not one promise of attainment of his DESIRE had been held out to him. To everyone, except himself, he appeared</P>

<P class="p19 ft10">only another cog in the Edison business wheel, but in his own mind, HE WAS THE PARTNER OF EDISON EVERY MINUTE OF THE TIME, from the very day that he ﬁrst went to work there.</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">It is a remarkable illustration of the power of a DEFINITE DESIRE. Barnes won his goal, because he wanted to be a business associate of Mr. Edison, more than he wanted anything else. He created a plan by which to attain that purpose. But he BURNED ALL BRIDGES BEHIND HIM. He stood by his DESIRE until it be- came the dominating obsession of his <NOBR>life-and-ﬁnally,</NOBR> a fact.</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">When he went to Orange, he did not say to himself, “I will try to induce Edison to give me a job of some soft.” He said, “I will see Edison, and put him on notice that I have come to go into business with him.</P>
<P class="p12 ft10">He did not say, “I will work there for a few months, and if I get no encouragement, I will quit and get a job somewhere else.” He did say, “I will start anywhere. I will do anything Edison tells me to do, but before I am through, I will be his associ- ate.”</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">He did not say, “I will keep my eyes open for another opportunity, in case I fail to get what I want in the Edison organization.” He said, “There is but ONE thing in this world that I am determined to have, and that is a business association with Thomas A. Edison. I will burn all bridges behind me, and stake my ENTIRE FU- TURE on my ability to get what I want.”</P>
<P class="p46 ft8">He left himself no possible way of retreat. He had to win or perish!</P>
<P class="p20 ft10">That is all there is to the Barnes story of success! A long while ago, a great war- rior faced a situation which made it necessary for him to make a decision which insured his success on the battleﬁeld. He was about to send his armies against a powerful foe, whose men outnumbered his own. He loaded his soldiers into boats, sailed to the enemy’s country, unloaded soldiers and equipment, then gave the order to burn the ships that had carried them. Addressing his men before the ﬁrst battle, he said, “You see the boats going up in smoke. That means that we cannot leave these shores alive unless we win! We now have no <NOBR>choice-we</NOBR> <NOBR>win-or</NOBR> we perish! They won.</P>
<P class="p33 ft10">Every person who wins in any undertaking must be willing to burn his ships and cut all sources of retreat. Only by so doing can one be sure of maintaining that state of mind known as a BURNING DESIRE TO WIN, essential to success.</P>

<P class="p15 ft10">The morning after the great Chicago ﬁre, a group of merchants stood on State Street, looking at the smoking remains of what had been their stores. They went into a conference to decide if they would try to rebuild, or leave Chicago and start over in a more promising section of the country. They reached a <NOBR>decision-all</NOBR> ex- cept <NOBR>one-to</NOBR> leave Chicago.</P>
<P class="p17 ft10">The merchant who decided to stay and rebuild pointed a ﬁnger at the remains of his store, and said, “Gentlemen, on that very spot I will build the world’s greatest store, no matter how many times it may burn down.”</P>
<P class="p17 ft10">That was more than ﬁfty years ago. The store was built. It stands there today, a towering monument to the power of that state of mind known as a BURNING DESIRE. The easy thing for Marshal Field to have done, would have been exactly what his fellow merchants did. When the going was hard, and the future looked dismal, they pulled up and went where the going seemed easier.</P>
<P class="p17 ft10">Mark well this difference between Marshal Field and the other merchants, be- cause it is the same difference which distinguishes Edwin C. Barnes from thou- sands of other young men who have worked in the Edison organization. It is the same difference which distinguishes practically all who succeed from those who fail.</P>
<P class="p17 ft10">Every human being who reaches the age of understanding of the purpose of mon- ey, wishes for it. Wishing will not bring riches. But desiring riches with a state of mind that becomes an obsession, then planning deﬁnite ways and means to ac- quire riches, and backing those plans with persistence which does not recognize failure, will bring riches.</P>
<P class="p17 ft10">The method by which DESIRE for riches can be transmuted into its ﬁnancial equivalent, consists of six deﬁnite, practical steps, viz: First. Fix in your mind the exact amount of money you desire. It is not sufﬁcient merely to say “I want plenty of money.”</P>
<P class="p18 ft10"><SPAN class="ft15">First</SPAN>. Be deﬁnite as to the amount. (There is a psychological reason for deﬁnite- ness which will be described in a subsequent chapter).</P>
<P class="p18 ft10"><SPAN class="ft15">Second</SPAN>. Determine exactly what you intend to give in return for the money you desire. (There is no such reality as “something for nothing.)</P>
<P class="p18 ft10"><SPAN class="ft15">Third</SPAN>. Establish a deﬁnite date when you intend to possess the money you de- sire.</P>

<P class="p34 ft10"><SPAN class="ft15">Fourth</SPAN>. Create a deﬁnite plan for carrying out your desire, and begin at once, whether you are ready or not, to put this plan into action.</P>
<P class="p36 ft10"><SPAN class="ft15">Fifth</SPAN>. Write out a clear, concise statement of the amount of money you intend to acquire, name the time limit for its acquisition, state what you intend to give in return for the money, and describe clearly the plan through which you intend to accumulate it.</P>
<P class="p44 ft10"><SPAN class="ft15">Sixth</SPAN>. Read your written statement aloud, twice daily, once just before retiring at night, and once after arising in the morning. AS YOU <NOBR>READ-SEE</NOBR> AND FEEL AND BELIEVE YOURSELF ALREADY IN POSSESSION OF THE MONEY.</P>
<P class="p61 ft10">It is important that you follow the instructions described in these six steps. It is especially important that you observe, and follow the instructions in the sixth paragraph. You may complain that it is impossible for you to “see yourself in pos- session of money” before you actually have it. Here is where a BURNING DESIRE will come to your aid. If you truly DESIRE money so keenly that your desire is an obsession, you will have no difﬁculty in convincing yourself that you will acquire it. The object is to want money, and to become so determined to have it that you CONVINCE yourself you will have it.</P>
<P class="p16 ft10">Only those who become “money conscious” ever accumulate great riches. “Money consciousness” means that the mind has become so thoroughly saturated with the DESIRE for money, that one can see one’s self already in possession of it.</P>
<P class="p44 ft10">To the uninitiated, who has not been schooled in the working principles of the human mind, these instructions may appear impractical. It may be helpful, to all who fail to recognize the soundness of the six steps, to know that the informa- tion they convey, was received from Andrew Carnegie, who began as an ordinary laborer in the steel mills, but managed, despite his humble beginning, to make these principles yield him a fortune of considerably more than one hundred mil- lion dollars.</P>
<P class="p44 ft10">It may be of further help to know that the six steps here recommended were carefully scrutinized by the late Thomas A. Edison, who placed his stamp of approval upon them as being, not only the steps essential for the accumulation of money, but necessary for the attainment of any deﬁnite goal.</P>
<P class="p44 ft10">The steps call for no “hard labor.” They call for no sacriﬁce. They do not require one to become ridiculous, or credulous. To apply them calls for no great amount of education. But the successful application of these six steps does call for suf- ﬁcient imagination to enable one to see, and to understand, that accumulation</P>

<P class="p15 ft10">of money cannot be left to chance, good fortune, and luck. One must realize that all who have accumulated great fortunes, ﬁrst did a certain amount of dreaming, hoping, wishing, DESIRING, and PLANNING before they acquired money.</P>
<P class="p17 ft10">You may as well know, right here, that you can never have riches in great quanti- ties, UNLESS you can work yourself into a white heat of DESIRE for money, and actually BELIEVE you will possess it.</P>
<P class="p18 ft12">You may as well know, also that every great leader, from the dawn of civilization down to the present, was a dreamer.</P>
<P class="p16 ft10">Christianity is the greatest potential power in the world today, because its found- er was an intense dreamer who had the vision and the imagination to see realities in their mental and spiritual form before they had been transmuted into physical form.</P>
<P class="p17 ft10">If you do not see great riches in your imagination, you will never see them in your bank balance. Never, in the history of America has there been so great an oppor- tunity for practical dreamers as now exists. The six year economic collapse has reduced all men, substantially, to the same level. A new race is about to be run. The stakes represent huge fortunes which will be accumulated within the next ten years. The rules of the race have changed, because we now live in a CHANGED WORLD that deﬁnitely favors the masses, those who had but little or no opportu- nity to win under the conditions existing during the depression, when fear para- lyzed growth and development.</P>
<P class="p16 ft10">We who are in this race for riches, should be encouraged to know that this changed world in which we live is demanding new ideas, new ways of doing things, new leaders, new inventions, new methods of teaching, new methods of marketing, new books, new literature, new features for the radio, new ideas for moving pic- tures.</P>
<P class="p17 ft10">Back of all this demand for new and better things, there is one quality which one must possess to win, and that is DEFINITENESS OF PURPOSE, the knowledge of what one wants, and a burning DESIRE to possess it.</P>
<P class="p18 ft10">The business depression marked the death of one age, and the birth of anoth- er. This changed world requires practical dreamers who can, and will put their dreams into action. The practical dreamers have always been, and always will be the <NOBR>pattern-makers</NOBR> of civilization.</P>

<P class="p19 ft10">We who desire to accumulate riches, should remember the real leaders of the world always have been men who harnessed, and put into practical use, the intan- gible, unseen forces of unborn opportunity, and have converted those forces, [or impulses of thought], into <NOBR>sky-scrapers,</NOBR> cities, factories, airplanes, automobiles, and every form of convenience that makes life more pleasant.</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">Tolerance, and an open mind are practical necessities of the dreamer of today. Those who are afraid of new ideas are doomed before they start. Never has there been a time more favorable to pioneers than the present. True, there is no wild and woolly west to be conquered, as in the days of the Covered Wagon; but there is a vast business, ﬁnancial, and industrial world to be remoulded and redirected along new and better lines.</P>
<P class="p20 ft10">In planning to acquire your share of the riches, let no one inﬂuence you to scorn the dreamer. To win the big stakes in this changed world, you must catch the spirit of the great pioneers of the past, whose dreams have given to civilization all that it has of value, the spirit which serves as the <NOBR>life-blood</NOBR> of our own country- your opportunity and mine, to develop and market our talents.</P>
<P class="p13 ft12">Let us not forget, Columbus dreamed of an Unknown world, staked his life on the existence of such a world, and discovered it!</P>
<P class="p20 ft10">Copernicus, the great astronomer, dreamed of a multiplicity of worlds, and re- vealed them! No one denounced him as “impractical” after he had triumphed. Instead, the world worshipped at his shrine, thus proving once more that “SUC-</P>
<P class="p62 ft8">CESS REQUIRES NO APOLOGIES, FAILURE PERMITS NO ALIBIS.”</P>
<P class="p20 ft10">If the thing you wish to do is right, and you believe in it, go ahead and do it! Put your dream across, and never mind what “they” say if you meet with temporary defeat, for “they,” perhaps, do not know that EVERY FAILURE BRINGS WITH IT THE SEED OF AN EQUIVALENT SUCCESS.</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">Henry Ford, poor and uneducated, dreamed of a horseless carriage, went to work with what tools he possessed, without waiting for opportunity to favor him, and now evidence of his dream belts the entire earth. He has put more wheels into operation than any man who ever lived, because he was not afraid to back his dreams.</P>
<P class="p14 ft11">Thomas Edison dreamed of a lamp that could be operated by electricity, began where he stood to put his dream into action, and despite more than ten thousand failures, he stood by that dream until he made it a physical reality. Practical dreamers DO NOT QUIT! Whelan dreamed of a chain of cigar stores, transformed</P>

<P class="p13 ft12">The Wright brothers dreamed of a machine that would ﬂy through the air. Now one may see evidence all over the world, that they dreamed soundly.</P>
<P class="p20 ft10">Marconi dreamed of a system for harnessing the intangible forces of the ether. Evidence that he did not dream in vain, may be found in every wireless and ra- dio in the world. Moreover, Marconi’s dream brought the humblest cabin, and the most stately manor house side by side. It made the people of every nation on earth <NOBR>back-door</NOBR> neighbors. It gave the President of the United States a medium by which he may talk to all the people of America at one time, and on short notice. It may interest you to know that Marconi’s “friends” had him taken into custody, and examined in a psychopathic hospital, when he announced he had discovered a principle through which he could send messages through the air, without the aid of wires, or other direct physical means of communication. The dreamers of today fare better.</P>

<P class="p38 ft10">“The oak sleeps in the acorn. The bird waits in the egg, and in the highest vision of the soul, a waking angel stirs. DREAMS ARE THE SEEDLINGS OF REALITY.”</P>
<P class="p12 ft10">Awake, arise, and assert yourself, you dreamers of the world. Your star is now in the ascendency. The world depression brought the opportunity you have been waiting for. It taught people humility, tolerance, and <NOBR>open-mindedness.</NOBR></P>
<P class="p13 ft12">The world is ﬁlled with an abundance of OPPORTUNITY which the dreamers of the past never knew.</P>
<P class="p20 ft10">A BURNING DESIRE TO BE, AND TO DO is the starting point from which the dreamer must take off. Dreams are not born of indifference, laziness, or lack of ambition.</P>

<P class="p34 ft10">The world no longer scoffs at the dreamer, nor calls him impractical. If you think it does, take a trip to Tennessee, and witness what a dreamer President has done in the way of harnessing, and using the great water power of America. A score of years ago, such a dream would have seemed like madness.</P>
<P class="p44 ft10">You have been disappointed, you have undergone defeat during the depression, you have felt the great heart within you crushed until it bled. Take courage, for these experiences have tempered the spiritual metal of which you are <NOBR>made-they</NOBR> are assets of incomparable value.</P>
<P class="p44 ft10">Remember, too, that all who succeed in life get off to a bad start, and pass through many heartbreaking struggles before they “arrive.” The turning point in the lives of those who succeed, usually comes at the moment of some crisis, through which they are introduced to their “other selves.”</P>
<P class="p36 ft10">John Bunyan wrote the Pilgrim’s Progress, which is among the ﬁnest of all Eng- lish literature, after he had been conﬁned in prison and sorely punished, because of his views on the subject of religion.</P>

Be- ing FORCED, through misfortune, to become acquainted with his “other self,” and to use his IMAGINATION, he discovered himself to be a great author instead of a miserable criminal and outcast. Strange and varied are the ways of life, and stranger still are the ways of Inﬁnite Intelligence, through which men are some- times forced to undergo all sorts of punishment before discovering their own brains, and their own capacity to create useful ideas through imagination.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p35 ft10">Edison, the world’s greatest inventor and scientist, was a “tramp” telegraph op- erator, he failed innumerable times before he was driven, ﬁnally, to the discovery of the genius which slept within his brain.</P>
<P class="p18 ft10">Charles Dickens began by pasting labels on blacking pots. The tragedy of his ﬁrst love penetrated the depths of his soul, and converted him into one of the world’s truly great authors. That tragedy produced, ﬁrst, David Copperﬁeld, then a suc- cession of other works that made this a richer and better world for all who read his books. Disappointment over love affairs, generally has the effect of driving men to drink, and women to ruin; and this, because most people never learn the art of transmuting their strongest emotions into dreams of a constructive nature.</P>

<P class="p18 ft10">Robert Burns was an illiterate country lad, he was cursed by poverty, and grew up to be a drunkard in the bargain. The world was made better for his having lived, because he clothed beautiful thoughts in poetry, and thereby plucked a thorn and planted a rose in its place.</P>
<P class="p17 ft10">Booker T. Washington was born in slavery, handicapped by race and color. Be- cause he was tolerant, had an open mind at all times, on all subjects, and was a DREAMER, he left his impress for good on an entire race.</P>
<P class="p18 ft10">Beethoven was deaf, Milton was blind, but their names will last as long as time endures, because they dreamed and translated their dreams into organized thought.</P>
<P class="p17 ft10">Before passing to the next chapter, kindle anew in your mind the ﬁre of hope, faith, courage, and tolerance. If you have these states of mind, and a working knowledge of the principles described, all else that you need will come to you, when you are READY for it. Let Emerson state the thought in these words, “Every proverb, every book, every byword that belongs to thee for aid and comfort shall surely come home through open or winding passages.</P>
<P class="p17 ft12">Every friend whom not thy fantastic will, but the great and tender soul in thee craveth, shall lock thee in his embrace.”</P>
<P class="p16 ft10">There is a difference between WISHING for a thing and being READY to receive it. No one is ready for a thing, until he believes he can acquire it. The state of mind must be BELIEF, not mere hope or wish. <NOBR>Open-mindedness</NOBR> is essential for belief. Closed minds do not inspire faith, courage, and belief.</P>
<P class="p17 ft10">Remember, no more effort is required to aim high in life, to demand abundance and prosperity, than is required to accept misery and poverty. A great poet has correctly stated this universal truth through these lines:</P>
<P class="p63 ft21">“I bargained with Life for a penny, And Life would pay no more, However I begged at evening When I counted my scanty store.</P>

<P class="p67 ft16">DESIRE OUTWITS MOTHER NATURE</P>
<P class="p58 ft10">As a ﬁtting climax to this chapter, I wish to introduce one of the most unusual persons I have ever known. I ﬁrst saw him <NOBR>twenty-four</NOBR> years ago, a few minutes after he was born. He came into the world without any physical sign of ears, and the doctor admitted, when pressed for an opinion, that the child might be deaf, and mute for life.</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">I challenged the doctor’s opinion. I had the right to do so, I was the child’s father. I, too, reached a decision, and rendered an opinion, but I expressed the opinion silently, in the secrecy of my own heart. I decided that my son would hear and speak. Nature could send me a child without ears, but Nature could not induce me to accept the reality of the afﬂiction.</P>
<P class="p14 ft11">In my own mind I knew that my son would hear and speak. How? I was sure there must be a way, and I knew I would ﬁnd it. I thought of the words of the immortal Emerson, “The whole course of things goes to teach us faith. We need only obey.</P>
<P class="p12 ft10">There is guidance for each of us, and by lowly listening, we shall hear the right word.”</P>
<P class="p12 ft10">The right word? DESIRE! More than anything else, I DESIRED that my son should not be a deaf mute. From that desire I never receded, not for a second.</P>
<P class="p12 ft10">Many years previously, I had written, “Our only limitations are those we set up in our own minds.” For the ﬁrst time, I wondered if that statement were true. Lying on the bed in front of me was a newly born child, without the natural equipment of hearing. Even though he might hear and speak, he was obviously disﬁgured for life. Surely, this was a limitation which that child had not set up in his own mind.</P>

<P class="p15 ft10">What could I do about it? Somehow I would ﬁnd a way to transplant into that child’s mind my own BURNING DESIRE for ways and means of conveying sound to his brain without the aid of ears. As soon as the child was old enough to coop- erate, I would ﬁll his mind so completely with a BURNING DESIRE to hear, that Nature would, by methods of her own, translate it into physical reality.</P>
<P class="p17 ft12">All this thinking took place in my own mind, but I spoke of it to no one. Every day I renewed the pledge I had made to myself, not to accept a deaf mute for a son.</P>
<P class="p35 ft10">As he grew older, and began to take notice of things around him, we observed that he had a slight degree of hearing. When he reached the age when children usually begin talking, he made no attempt to speak, but we could tell by his ac- tions that he could hear certain sounds slightly. That was all I wanted to know! I was convinced that if he could hear, even slightly, he might develop still greater hearing capacity. Then something happened which gave me hope. It came from an entirely unexpected source.</P>
<P class="p17 ft11">We bought a victrola. When the child heard the music for the ﬁrst time, he went into ecstasies, and promptly appropriated the machine. He soon showed a prefer- ence for certain records, among them, “It’s a Long Way to Tipperary.” On one oc- casion, he played that piece over and over, for almost two hours, standing in front of the victrola, with his teeth clamped on the edge of the case. The signiﬁcance of this <NOBR>self-formed</NOBR> habit of his did not become clear to us until years afterward, for we had never heard of the principle of “bone conduction” of sound at that time.</P>
<P class="p35 ft10">Shortly after he appropriated the victrola, I discovered that he could hear me quite clearly when I spoke with my lips touching his mastoid bone, or at the base of the brain. These discoveries placed in my possession the necessary media by which I began to translate into reality my Burning Desire to help my son develop hearing and speech. By that time he was making stabs at speaking certain words. The outlook was far from encouraging, but DESIRE BACKED BY FAITH knows no such word as impossible.</P>
<P class="p35 ft10">Having determined that he could hear the sound of my voice plainly, I began, immediately, to transfer to his mind the desire to hear and speak. I soon discov- ered that the child enjoyed bedtime stories, so I went to work, creating stories designed to develop in him <NOBR>self-reliance,</NOBR> imagination, and a keen desire to hear and to be normal.</P>
<P class="p44 ft12">There was one story in particular, which I emphasized by giving it some new and dramatic coloring each time it was told. It was designed to plant in his mind the</P>

<P class="p39 ft10">thought that his afﬂiction was not a liability, but an asset of great value. Despite the fact that all the philosophy I had examined clearly indicated that EVERY AD-</P>
<P class="p68 ft10">VERSITY BRINGS WITH IT THE SEED OF AN EQUIVALENT ADVANTAGE, I must confess that I had not the slightest idea how this afﬂiction could ever be- come an asset. However, I continued my practice of wrapping that philosophy in bedtime stories, hoping the time would come when he would ﬁnd some plan by which his handicap could be made to serve some useful purpose.</P>
<P class="p13 ft12">Reason told me plainly, that there was no adequate compensation for the lack of ears and natural hearing equipment.</P>
<P class="p21 ft8">DESIRE backed by FAITH, pushed reason aside, and inspired me to carry on.</P>
<P class="p33 ft12">As I analyze the experience in retrospect, I can see now, that my son’s faith in me had much to do with the astounding results.</P>
<P class="p20 ft10">He did not question anything I told him. I sold him the idea that he had a distinct advantage over his older brother, and that this advantage would reﬂect itself in many ways. For example, the teachers in school would observe that he had no ears, and, because of this, they would show him special attention and treat him with extraordinary kindness. They always did. His mother saw to that, by visiting the teachers and arranging with them to give the child the extra attention neces- sary. I sold him the idea, too, that when he became old enough to sell newspapers, (his older brother had already become a newspaper merchant), he would have a big advantage over his brother, for the reason that people would pay him extra money for his wares, because they could see that he was a bright, industrious boy, despite the fact he had no ears.</P>
<P class="p33 ft10">We could notice that, gradually, the child’s hearing was improving. Moreover, he had not the slightest tendency to be <NOBR>self-conscious,</NOBR> because of his afﬂiction. When he was about seven, he showed the ﬁrst evidence that our method of serv- icing his mind was bearing fruit. For several months he begged for the privilege of selling newspapers, but his mother would not give her consent. She was afraid that his deafness made it unsafe for him to go on the street alone.</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">Finally, he took matters in his own hands. One afternoon, when he was left at home with the servants, he climbed through the kitchen window, shinnied to the ground, and set out on his own. He borrowed six cents in capital from the neigh- borhood shoemaker, invested it in papers, sold out, reinvested, and kept repeat- ing until late in the evening. After balancing his accounts, and paying back the six cents he had borrowed from his banker, he had a net proﬁt of <NOBR>forty-two</NOBR> cents. When we got home that night, we found him in bed asleep, with the money tightly clenched in his hand.</P>

<P class="p34 ft10">His mother opened his hand, removed the coins, and cried. Of all things! Crying over her son’s ﬁrst victory seemed so inappropriate. My reaction was the reverse. I laughed heartily, for I knew that my endeavor to plant in the child’s mind an at- titude of faith in himself had been successful.</P>
<P class="p36 ft10">His mother saw, in his ﬁrst business venture, a little deaf boy who had gone out in the streets and risked his life to earn money. I saw a brave, ambitious, self- reliant little business man whose stock in himself had been increased a hundred percent, because he had gone into business on his own initiative, and had won. The transaction pleased me, because I knew that he had given evidence of a trait of resourcefulness that would go with him all through life.</P>
<P class="p35 ft10">Later events proved this to be true. When his older brother wanted something, he would lie down on the ﬂoor, kick his feet in the air, cry for <NOBR>it-and</NOBR> get it. When the “little deaf boy” wanted something, he would plan a way to earn the money, then buy it for himself. He still follows that plan!</P>
<P class="p36 ft10">Truly, my own son has taught me that handicaps can be converted into stepping stones on which one may climb toward some worthy goal, unless they are ac- cepted as obstacles, and used as alibis.</P>
<P class="p44 ft10">The little deaf boy went through the grades, high school, and college without being able to hear his teachers, excepting when they shouted loudly, at close range. He did not go to a school for the deaf. WE WOULD NOT PERMIT HIM TO LEARN THE SIGN LANGUAGE. We were determined that he should live a normal life, and associate with normal children, and we stood by that decision, although it cost us many heated debates with school ofﬁcials.</P>
<P class="p44 ft10">While he was in high school, he tried an electrical hearing aid, but it was of no value to him; due, we believed, to a condition that was disclosed when the child was six, by Dr. J. Gordon Wilson, of Chicago, when he operated on one side of the boy’s head, and discovered that there was no sign of natural hearing equipment. During his last week in college, (eighteen years after the operation), something happened which marked the most important <NOBR>turning-point</NOBR> of his life.</P>
<P class="p17 ft11">Through what seemed to be mere chance, he came into possession of another electrical hearing device, which was sent to him on trial. He was slow about test- ing it, due to his disappointment with a similar device. Finally he picked the in- strument up, and more or less carelessly, placed it on his head, hooked up the battery, and lo! as if by a stroke of magic, his lifelong DESIRE FOR NORMAL HEARING BECAME A REALITY! For the ﬁrst time in his life he heard practically</P>

<P class="p18 ft10">Overjoyed because of the Changed World which had been brought to him through his hearing device, he rushed to the telephone, called his mother, and heard her voice perfectly. The next day he plainly heard the voices of his professors in class, for the ﬁrst time in his life! Previously he could hear them only when they shout- ed, at short range. He heard the radio. He heard the talking pictures. For the ﬁrst time in his life, he could converse freely with other people, without the necessity of their having to speak loudly. Truly, he had come into possession of a Changed World. We had refused to accept Nature’s error, and, by PERSISTENT DESIRE, we had induced Nature to correct that error, through the only practical means available.</P>
<P class="p23 ft10">DESIRE had commenced to pay dividends, but the victory was not yet complete. The boy still had to ﬁnd a deﬁnite and practical way to convert his handicap into an equivalent asset.</P>
<P class="p18 ft10">Hardly realizing the signiﬁcance of what had already been accomplished, but in- toxicated with the joy of his newly discovered world of sound, he wrote a letter to the manufacturer of the <NOBR>hearing-aid,</NOBR> enthusiastically describing his experience. Something in his letter; something, perhaps which was not written on the lines, but back of them; caused the company to invite him to New York. When be ar- rived, he was escorted through the factory, and while talking with the Chief Engi- neer, telling him about his changed world, a hunch, an idea, or an <NOBR>inspiration-call</NOBR> it what you <NOBR>wish-ﬂashed</NOBR> into his mind. It was this impulse of thought which con- verted his afﬂiction into an asset, destined to pay dividends in both money and happiness to thousands for all time to come.</P>
<P class="p23 ft10">The sum and substance of that impulse of thought was this: It occurred to him that he might be of help to the millions of deafened people who go through life without the beneﬁt of hearing devices, if he could ﬁnd a way to tell them the story of his Changed World.</P>
<P class="p17 ft12">Then and there, he reached a decision to devote the remainder of his life to ren- dering useful service to the hard of hearing.</P>
<P class="p16 ft10">For an entire month, he carried on an intensive research, during which he an- alyzed the entire marketing system of the manufacturer of the hearing device, and created ways and means of communicating with the hard of hearing all over the world for the purpose of sharing with them his newly discovered “Changed World.” When this was done, he put in writing a <NOBR>two-year</NOBR> plan, based upon his</P>

<P class="p34 ft10">ﬁndings. When he presented the plan to the company, he was instantly given a position, for the purpose of carrying out his ambition.</P>
<P class="p36 ft10">Little did he dream, when he went to work, that he was destined to bring hope and practical relief to thousands of deafened people who, without his help, would have been doomed forever to deaf mutism.</P>
<P class="p44 ft10">Shortly after he became associated with the manufacturer of his hearing aid, he invited me to attend a class conducted by his company, for the purpose of teach- ing deaf mutes to hear, and to speak. I had never heard of such a form of educa- tion, therefore I visited the class, skeptical but hopeful that my time would not be entirely wasted. Here I saw a demonstration which gave me a greatly enlarged vision of what I had done to arouse and keep alive in my son’s mind the DESIRE for normal hearing. I saw deaf mutes actually being taught to hear and to speak, through application of the <NOBR>self-same</NOBR> principle I had used, more than twenty years previously, in saving my son from deaf mutism.</P>
<P class="p35 ft10">Thus, through some strange turn of the Wheel of Fate, my son, Blair, and I have been destined to aid in correcting deaf mutism for those as yet unborn, because we are the only living human beings, as far as I know, who have established deﬁ- nitely the fact that deaf mutism can be corrected to the extent of restoring to normal life those who suffer with this afﬂiction. It has been done for one; it will be done for others.</P>
<P class="p44 ft10">There is no doubt in my mind that Blair would have been a deaf mute all his life, if his mother and I had not managed to shape his mind as we did. The doctor who attended at his birth told us, conﬁdentially, the child might never hear or speak. A few weeks ago, Dr. Irving Voorhees, a noted specialist on such cases, examined Blair very thoroughly. He was astounded when he learned how well my son now hears, and speaks, and said his examination indicated that “theoretically, the boy should not be able to hear at all.” But the lad does hear, despite the fact that <NOBR>X-ray</NOBR> pictures show there is no opening in the skull, whatsoever, from where his ears should be to the brain.</P>
<P class="p23 ft10">When I planted in his mind the DESIRE to hear and talk, and live as a normal person, there went with that impulse some strange inﬂuence which caused Na- ture to become <NOBR>bridge-builder,</NOBR> and span the gulf of silence between his brain and the outer world, by some means which the keenest medical specialists have not been able to interpret. It would be sacrilege for me to even conjecture as to how Nature performed this miracle. It would be unforgivable if I neglected to tell the world as much as I know of the humble part I assumed in the strange experience. It is my duty, and a privilege to say I believe, and not without reason, that nothing is impossible to the person who backs DESIRE with enduring FAITH.</P>

<P class="p34 ft10">Verily, a BURNING DESIRE has devious ways of transmuting itself into its physi- cal equivalent. Blair DESIRED normal hearing; now he has it! He was born with a handicap which might easily have sent one with a less deﬁned DESIRE to the street with a bundle of pencils and a tin cup. That handicap now promises to serve as the medium by which he will render useful service to many millions of hard of hearing, also, to give him useful employment at adequate ﬁnancial compensation the remainder of his life.</P>
<P class="p17 ft10">The little “white lies” I planted in his mind when he was a child, by leading him to BELIEVE his afﬂiction would become a great asset, which he could capitalize, has justiﬁed itself. Verily, there is nothing, right or wrong, which BELIEF, plus BURNING DESIRE, cannot make real. These qualities are free to everyone. In all my experience in dealing with men and women who had personal problems, I never handled a single case which more deﬁnitely demonstrates the power of DE- SIRE. Authors sometimes make the mistake of writing of subjects of which they have but superﬁcial, or very elementary knowledge. It has been my good fortune to have had the privilege of testing the soundness of the POWER OF DESIRE, through the afﬂiction of my own son. Perhaps it was providential that the experi- ence came as it did, for surely no one is better prepared than he, to serve as an example of what happens when DESIRE is put to the test. If Mother Nature bends to the will of desire, is it logical that mere men can defeat a burning desire?</P>
<P class="p69 ft10">Strange and imponderable is the power of the human mind! We do not under- stand the method by which it uses every circumstance, every individual, every physical thing within its reach, as a means of transmuting DESIRE into its physi- cal counterpart. Perhaps science will uncover this secret. I planted in my son’s mind the DESIRE to hear and to speak as any normal person hears and speaks. That DESIRE has now become a reality. I planted in his mind the DESIRE to con- vert his greatest handicap into his greatest asset. That DESIRE has been realized. The modus operandi by which this astounding result was achieved is not hard to describe. It consisted of three very deﬁnite facts; ﬁrst, I MIXED FAITH with the DESIRE for normal hearing, which I passed on to my son. Second, I communi- cated my desire to him in every conceivable way available, through persistent, continuous effort, over a period of years. Third, HE BELIEVED ME!</P>
<P class="p43 ft10">As this chapter was being completed, news came of the death of Mme. Schuman- Heink. One short paragraph in the news dispatch gives the clue to this unusual woman’s stupendous success as a singer. I quote the paragraph, because the clue it contains is none other than DESIRE.</P>

<P class="p39 ft11">Early in her career, Mme. <NOBR>Schuman-Heink</NOBR> visited the director of the Vienna Court Opera, to have him test her voice. But, he did not test it. After taking one look at the awkward and poorly dressed girl, he exclaimed, none too gently, “With such a face, and with no personality at all, how can you ever expect to succeed in opera? My good child, give up the idea. Buy a sewing machine, and go to work.</P>
<P class="p46 ft8">YOU CAN NEVER BE A SINGER.”</P>
<P class="p33 ft10">Never is a long time! The director of the Vienna Court Opera knew much about the technique of singing. He knew little about the power of desire, when it as- sumes the proportion of an obsession. If he had known more of that power, he would not have made the mistake of condemning genius without giving it an op- portunity. Several years ago, one of my business associates became ill. He became worse as time went on, and ﬁnally was taken to the hospital for an operation. Just before he was wheeled into the operating room, I took a look at him, and wondered how anyone as thin and emaciated as he, could possibly go through a major operation successfully. The doctor warned me that there was little if any chance of my ever seeing him alive again. But that was the DOCTOR’S OPINION. It was not the opinion of the patient. Just before he was wheeled away, he whis- pered feebly, “Do not be disturbed, Chief, I will be out of here in a few days.” The attending nurse looked at me with pity. But the patient did come through safely. After it was all over, his physician said, “Nothing but his own desire to live saved him. He never would have pulled through if he had not refused to accept the pos- sibility of death.”</P>
<P class="p70 ft10">I believe in the power of DESIRE backed by FAITH, because I have seen this power lift men from lowly beginnings to places of power and wealth; I have seen it rob the grave of its victims; I have seen it serve as the medium by which men staged a comeback after having been defeated in a hundred different ways; I have seen it provide my own son with a normal, happy, successful life, despite Nature’s having sent him into the world without ears.</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">How can one harness and use the power of DESIRE? This has been answered through this, and the subsequent chapters of this book. This message is going out to the world at the end of the longest, and perhaps, the most devastating depres- sion America has ever known. It is reasonable to presume that the message may come to the attention of many who have been wounded by the depression, those who have lost their fortunes, others who have lost their positions, and great num- bers who must reorganize their plans and stage a comeback. To all these I wish to convey the thought that all achievement, no matter what may be its nature, or its purpose, must begin with an intense, BURNING DESIRE for something deﬁ- nite.</P>

<P class="p33 ft10">FAITH is the head chemist of the mind. When FAITH is blended with the vibra- tion of thought, the subconscious mind instantly picks up the vibration, trans- lates it into its spiritual equivalent, and transmits it to Inﬁnite Intelligence, as in the case of prayer.</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">The emotions of FAITH, LOVE, and SEX are the most powerful of all the major positive emotions. When the three are blended, they have the effect of “coloring” the vibration of thought in such a way that it instantly reaches the subconscious mind, where it is changed into its spiritual equivalent, the only form that induces a response from Inﬁnite Intelligence.</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">Love and faith are psychic; related to the spiritual side of man. Sex is purely bio- logical, and related only to the physical. The mixing, or blending, of these three emotions has the effect of opening a direct line of communication between the ﬁnite, thinking mind of man, and Inﬁnite Intelligence.</P>
<P class="p75 ft16">How To Develop Faith</P>
<P class="p76 ft10">There comes, now, a statement which will give a better understanding of the importance the principle of <NOBR>auto-suggestion</NOBR> assumes in the transmutation of de- sire into its physical, or monetary equivalent; namely: FAITH is a state of mind which may be induced, or created, by afﬁrmation or repeated instructions to the subconscious mind, through the principle of <NOBR>auto-suggestion.</NOBR></P>
<P class="p14 ft11">As an illustration, consider the purpose for which you are, presumably, reading this book. The object is, naturally, to acquire the ability to transmute the intangi- ble thought impulse of DESIRE into its physical counterpart, money. By following the instructions laid down in the chapters on <NOBR>auto-suggestion,</NOBR> and the subcon- scious mind, as summarized in the chapter on <NOBR>auto-suggestion,</NOBR> you may CON- VINCE the subconscious mind that you believe you will receive that for which you ask, and it will act upon that belief, which your subconscious mind passes back to</P>

<P class="p34 ft10">you in the form of “FAITH,” followed by deﬁnite plans for procuring that which you desire.</P>
<P class="p36 ft10">The method by which one develops FAITH, where it does not already exist, is ex- tremely difﬁcult to describe, almost as difﬁcult, in fact, as it would be to describe the color of red to a blind man who has never seen color, and has nothing with which to compare what you describe to him. Faith is a state of mind which you may develop at will, after you have mastered the thirteen principles, because it is a state of mind which develops voluntarily, through application and use of these principles.</P>
<P class="p35 ft10">Repetition of afﬁrmation of orders to your subconscious mind is the only known method of voluntary development of the emotion of faith. Perhaps the meaning may be made clearer through the following explanation as to the way men some- times become criminals. Stated in the words of a famous criminologist, “When men ﬁrst come into contact with crime, they abhor it. If they remain in contact with crime for a time, they become accustomed to it, and endure it. If they remain in contact with it long enough, they ﬁnally embrace it, and become inﬂuenced by it.”</P>
<P class="p35 ft10">This is the equivalent of saying that any impulse of thought which is repeatedly passed on to the subconscious mind is, ﬁnally, accepted and acted upon by the subconscious mind, which proceeds to translate that impulse into its physical equivalent, by the most practical procedure available.</P>
<P class="p44 ft10">In connection with this, consider again the statement, ALL THOUGHTS WHICH HAVE BEEN EMOTIONALIZED, (given feeling) AND MIXED WITH FAITH, be- gin immediately to translate themselves into their physical equivalent or counter- part.</P>
<P class="p36 ft10">The emotions, or the “feeling” portion of thoughts, are the factors which give thoughts vitality, life, and action. The emotions of Faith, Love, and Sex, when mixed with any thought impulse, give it greater action than any of these emotions can do singly.</P>
<P class="p44 ft10">Not only thought impulses which have been mixed with FAITH, but those which have been mixed with any of the positive emotions, or any of the negative emo- tions, may reach, and inﬂuence the subconscious mind.</P>
<P class="p18 ft11">From this statement, you will understand that the subconscious mind will trans- late into its physical equivalent, a thought impulse of a negative or destructive na- ture, just as readily as it will act upon thought impulses of a positive or construc-</P>

<P class="p15 ft10">tive nature. This accounts for the strange phenomenon which so many millions of people experience, referred to as “misfortune,” or “bad luck.” There are millions of people who BELIEVE themselves “doomed” to poverty and failure, because of some strange force over which they BELIEVE they have no control. They are the creators of their own “misfortunes,” because of this negative BELIEF, which is picked up by the subconscious mind, and translated into its physical equivalent.</P>
<P class="p35 ft10">This is an appropriate place at which to suggest again that you may beneﬁt, by passing on to your subconscious mind, any DESIRE which you wish translated into its physical, or monetary equivalent, in a state of expectancy or BELIEF that the transmutation will actually take place. Your BELIEF, or FAITH, is the ele- ment which determines the action of your subconscious mind. There is nothing to hinder you from “deceiving” your subconscious mind when giving it instructions through autosuggestion, as I deceived my son’s subconscious mind.</P>
<P class="p44 ft10">To make this “deceit” more realistic, conduct yourself just as you would, if you were ALREADY IN POSSESSION OF THE MATERIAL THING WHICH YOU ARE DEMANDING, when you call upon your subconscious mind.</P>
<P class="p44 ft10">The subconscious mind will transmute into its physical equivalent, by the most direct and practical media available, any order which is given to it in a state of BELIEF, or FAITH that the order will be carried out.</P>
<P class="p36 ft10">Surely, enough has been stated to give a starting point from which one may, through experiment and practice, acquire the ability to mix FAITH with any or- der given to the subconscious mind.</P>
<P class="p36 ft10">Perfection will come through practice. It cannot come by merely reading instruc- tions.</P>
<P class="p18 ft11">If it be true that one may become a criminal by association with crime, (and this is a known fact), it is equally true that one may develop faith by voluntarily suggest- ing to the subconscious mind that one has faith. The mind comes, ﬁnally, to take on the nature of the inﬂuences which dominate it. Understand this truth, and you will know why it is essential for you to encourage the positive emotions as domi- nating forces of your mind, and discourage and eliminate negative emotions.</P>
<P class="p35 ft10">A mind dominated by positive emotions, becomes a favorable abode for the state of mind known as faith. A mind so dominated may, at will, give the subconscious mind instructions, which it will accept and act upon immediately.</P>

<P class="p19 ft15">FAITH IS A STATE OF MIND WHICH MAY BE INDUCED BY AUTO- SUGGESTION</P>
<P class="p77 ft10">All down the ages, the religionists have admonished struggling humanity to “have faith” in this, that, and the other dogma or creed, but they have failed to tell peo- ple HOW to have faith. They have not stated that “faith is a state of mind, and that it may be induced by <NOBR>self-suggestion.”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p13 ft10">In language which any normal human being can understand, we will describe all that is known about the principle through which FAITH may be developed, where it does not already exist. Have Faith in yourself; Faith in the Inﬁnite.</P>
<P class="p12 ft10">Before we begin, you should be reminded again that: FAITH is the “eternal elixir” which gives life, power, and action to the impulse of thought!</P>
<P class="p12 ft10">The foregoing sentence is worth reading a second time, and a third, and a fourth. It is worth reading aloud!</P>
<P class="p40 ft8">FAITH is the starting point of all accumulation of riches!</P>
<P class="p33 ft12">FAITH is the basis of all “miracles,” and all mysteries which cannot be analyzed by the rules of science!</P>
<P class="p21 ft8">FAITH is the only known antidote for FAILURE!</P>
<P class="p33 ft12">FAITH is the element, the “chemical” which, when mixed with prayer, gives one direct communication with Inﬁnite Intelligence.</P>
<P class="p20 ft12">FAITH is the element which transforms the ordinary vibration of thought, cre- ated by the ﬁnite mind of man, into the spiritual equivalent.</P>
<P class="p20 ft12">FAITH is the only agency through which the cosmic force of Inﬁnite Intelligence can be harnessed and used by man.</P>
<P class="p78 ft16">EVERY ONE OF THE FOREGOING STATEMENTS IS CAPABLE OF</P>
<P class="p79 ft16">PROOF!</P>
<P class="p33 ft10">The proof is simple and easily demonstrated. It is wrapped up in the principle of <NOBR>auto-suggestion.</NOBR> Let us center our attention, therefore, upon the subject of self- suggestion, and ﬁnd out what it is, and what it is capable of achieving. It is a well known fact that one comes, ﬁnally, to BELIEVE whatever one repeats to one’s self, whether the statement be true or false. If a man repeats a lie over and over,</P>

<P class="p19 ft10">he will eventually accept the lie as truth. Moreover, he will BELIEVE it to be the truth. Every man is what he is, because of the DOMINATING THOUGHTS which he permits to occupy his mind. Thoughts which a man deliberately places in his own mind, and encourages with sympathy, and with which he mixes any one or more of the emotions, constitute the motivating forces, which direct and control his every movement, act, and deed!</P>
<P class="p21 ft8">Comes, now, a very signiﬁcant statement of truth:</P>
<P class="p38 ft11">THOUGHTS WHICH ARE MIXED WITH ANY OF THE FEELINGS OF EMO- TIONS, CONSTITUTE A “MAGNETIC” FORCE WHICH ATTRACTS, FROM THE VIBRATIONS OF THE ETHER, OTHER SIMILAR, OR RELATED THOUGHTS.</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">A thought thus “magnetized” with emotion may be compared to a seed which, when planted in fertile soil, germinates, grows, and multiplies itself over and over again, until that which was originally one small seed, becomes countless millions of seeds of the SAME BRAND!</P>
<P class="p12 ft10">The ether is a great cosmic mass of eternal forces of vibration. It is made up of both destructive vibrations and constructive vibrations. It carries, at all times, vibrations of fear, poverty, disease, failure, misery; and vibrations of prosperity, health, success, and happiness, just as surely as it carries the sound of hundreds of orchestrations of music, and hundreds of human voices, all of which maintain their own individuality, and means of identiﬁcation, through the medium of ra- dio.</P>
<P class="p20 ft10">From the great storehouse of the ether, the human mind is constantly attracting vibrations which harmonize with that which DOMINATES the human mind. Any thought, idea, plan, or purpose which one holds in one’s mind attracts, from the vibrations of the ether, a host of its relatives, adds these “relatives” to its own force, and grows until it becomes the dominating, MOTIVATING MASTER of the individual in whose mind it has been housed.</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">Now, let us go back to the starting point, and become informed as to how the original seed of an idea, plan, or purpose may be planted in the mind. The infor- mation is easily conveyed: any idea, plan, or purpose may be placed in the mind through repetition of thought. This is why you are asked to write out a statement of your major purpose, or Deﬁnite Chief Aim, commit it to memory, and repeat it, in audible words, day after day, until these vibrations of sound have reached your subconscious mind.</P>

I will eliminate hatred, envy, jealousy, selﬁshness, and cynicism, by developing love for all humanity, because I know that a negative attitude toward others can never bring me success.

<P class="p34 ft10">I will sign my name to this formula, commit it to memory, and repeat it aloud once a day, with full FAITH that it will gradually inﬂuence my THOUGHTS and ACTIONS so that I will become a <NOBR>self-reliant,</NOBR> and successful person.</P>
<P class="p81 ft10">Back of this formula is a law of Nature which no man has yet been able to explain. It has bafﬂed the scientists of all ages. The psychologists have named this law <NOBR>“auto-suggestion,”</NOBR> and let it go at that.</P>
<P class="p36 ft10">The name by which one calls this law is of little importance. The important fact about it <NOBR>is-it</NOBR> WORKS for the glory and success of mankind, IF it is used construc- tively. On the other hand, if used destructively, it will destroy just as readily. In this statement may be found a very signiﬁcant truth, namely; that those who go down in defeat, and end their lives in poverty, misery, and distress, do so because of negative application of the principle of <NOBR>auto-suggestion.</NOBR></P>
<P class="p17 ft11">The cause may be found in the fact that ALL IMPULSES OF THOUGHT HAVE A TENDENCY TO CLOTHE THEMSELVES IN THEIR PHYSICAL EQUIVALENT.</P>
<P class="p36 ft10">The subconscious mind, (the chemical laboratory in which all thought impulses are combined, and made ready for translation into physical reality), makes no distinction between constructive and destructive thought impulses. It works with the material we feed it, through our thought impulses. The subconscious mind will translate into reality a thought driven by FEAR just as readily as it will trans- late into reality a thought driven by COURAGE, or FAITH.</P>
<P class="p35 ft10">The pages of medical history are rich with illustrations of cases of “suggestive sui- cide.” A man may commit suicide through negative suggestion, just as effectively as by any other means. In a midwestern city, a man by the name of Joseph Grant, a bank ofﬁcial, “borrowed” a large sum of the bank’s money, without the consent of the directors. He lost the money through gambling. One afternoon, the Bank Examiner came and began to check the accounts. Grant left the bank, took a room in a local hotel, and when they found him, three days later, he was lying in bed, wailing and moaning, repeating over and over these words, “My God, this will kill me! I cannot stand the disgrace.” In a short time he was dead. The doctors pro- nounced the case one of “mental suicide.”</P>
<P class="p35 ft10">Just as electricity will turn the wheels of industry, and render useful service if used constructively; or snuff out life if wrongly used, so will the law of <NOBR>auto-sug-</NOBR> gestion lead you to peace and prosperity. or down into the valley of misery, fail- ure, and death, according to your degree of understanding and application of it.</P>

<P class="p19 ft10">If you ﬁll your mind with FEAR, doubt and unbelief in your ability to connect with, and use the forces of Inﬁnite Intelligence, the law of <NOBR>auto-suggestion</NOBR> will take this spirit of unbelief and use it as a pattern by which your subconscious mind will translate it into its physical equivalent.</P>
<P class="p82 ft16">THIS STATEMENT IS AS TRUE AS THE STATEMENT THAT TWO</P>
<P class="p83 ft16">AND TWO ARE FOUR!</P>
<P class="p33 ft10">Like the wind which carries one ship East, and another West, the law of <NOBR>auto-sug-</NOBR> gestion will lift you up or pull you down, according to the way you set your sails of THOUGHT.</P>
<P class="p12 ft10">The law of <NOBR>auto-suggestion,</NOBR> through which any person may rise to altitudes of achievement which stagger the imagination, is well described in the following verse:</P>
<P class="p84 ft22">“If you think you are beaten, you are, If you think you dare not, you don’t</P>
<P class="p85 ft23">If you like to win, but you think you can’t,</P>

<P class="p87 ft23">“If you think you’ll lose, you’re lost</P>
<P class="p88 ft23">For out of the world we ﬁnd,</P>
<P class="p89 ft23">Success begins with a fellow’s will-</P>
<P class="p90 ft23">It’s all in the state of mind.</P>
<P class="p91 ft23">“If you think you are outclassed, you are,</P>
<P class="p92 ft23">You’ve got to think high to rise,</P>
<P class="p93 ft23">You’ve got to be sure of yourself before</P>
<P class="p94 ft23">You can ever win a prize.</P>
<P class="p95 ft21">“Life’s battles don’t always go To the stronger or faster man, But soon or late the man who wins Is the man WHO THINKS HE CAN!”</P>
<P class="p12 ft10">Observe the words which have been emphasized, and you will catch the deep meaning which the poet had in mind.</P>
<P class="p12 ft10">Somewhere in your <NOBR>make-up</NOBR> (perhaps in the cells of your brain) there lies sleep- ing, the seed of achievement which, if aroused and put into action, would carry you to heights, such as you may never have hoped to attain.</P>

<P class="p15 ft10">Just as a master musician may cause the most beautiful strains of music to pour forth from the strings of a violin, so may you arouse the genius which lies asleep in your brain, and cause it to drive you upward to whatever goal you may wish to achieve.</P>
<P class="p18 ft10">Abraham Lincoln was a failure at everything he tried, until he was well past the age of forty. He was a Mr. Nobody from Nowhere, until a great experience came into his life, aroused the sleeping genius within his heart and brain, and gave the world one of its really great men. That “experience” was mixed with the emotions of sorrow and LOVE. It came to him through Anne Rutledge, the only woman whom he ever truly loved.</P>
<P class="p16 ft10">It is a known fact that the emotion of LOVE is closely akin to the state of mind known as FAITH, and this for the reason that Love comes very near to trans- lating one’s thought impulses into their spiritual equivalent. During his work of research, the author discovered, from the analysis of the <NOBR>life-work</NOBR> and achieve- ments of hundreds of men of outstanding accomplishment, that there was the inﬂuence of a woman’s love back of nearly EVERY ONE OF THEM. The emotion of love, in the human heart and brain, creates a favorable ﬁeld of magnetic attrac- tion, which causes an inﬂux of the higher and ﬁner vibrations which are aﬂoat in the ether.</P>
<P class="p16 ft10">If you wish evidence of the power of FAITH, study the achievements of men and women who have employed it. At the head of the list comes the Nazarene. Chris- tianity is the greatest single force which inﬂuences the minds of men. The basis of Christianity is FAITH, no matter how many people may have perverted, or mis- interpreted the meaning of this great force, and no matter how many dogmas and creeds have been created in its name, which do not reﬂect its tenets.</P>
<P class="p17 ft10">The sum and substance of the teachings and the achievements of Christ, which may have been interpreted as “miracles,” were nothing more nor less than FAITH. If there are any such phenomena as “miracles” they are produced only through the state of mind known as FAITH! Some teachers of religion, and many who call themselves Christians, neither understand nor practice FAITH.</P>
<P class="p17 ft10">Let us consider the power of FAITH, as it is now being demonstrated, by a man who is well known to all of civilization, Mahatma Gandhi, of India. In this man the world has one of the most astounding examples known to civilization, of the possibilities of FAITH. Gandhi wields more potential power than any man living at this time, and this, despite the fact that he has none of the orthodox tools of power, such as money, battle ships, soldiers, and materials of warfare.

<P class="p34 ft10">has no money, he has no home, he does not own a suit of clothes, but HE DOES HAVE POWER. How does he come by that power?</P>
<P class="p36 ft10">HE CREATED IT OUT OF HIS UNDERSTANDING OF THE PRINCIPLE OF FAITH, AND THROUGH HIS ABILITY TO TRANSPLANT THAT FAITH INTO THE MINDS OF TWO HUNDRED MILLION PEOPLE.</P>
<P class="p44 ft10">Gandhi has accomplished, through the inﬂuence of FAITH, that which the strong- est military power on earth could not, and never will accomplish through soldiers and military equipment. He has accomplished the astounding feat of INFLUENC- ING two hundred million minds to COALESCE AND MOVE IN UNISON, AS A SINGLE MIND.</P>
<P class="p44 ft10">What other force on earth, except FAITH could do as much? There will come a day when employees as well as employers will discover the possibilities of FAITH. That day is dawning. The whole world has had ample opportunity, during the recent business depression, to witness what the LACK OF FAITH will do to busi- ness.</P>
<P class="p44 ft10">Surely, civilization has produced a sufﬁcient number of intelligent human beings to make use of this great lesson which the depression has taught the world. Dur- ing this depression, the world had evidence in abundance that widespread FEAR will paralyze the wheels of industry and business. Out of this experience will arise leaders in business and industry who will proﬁt by the example which Gandhi has set for the world, and they will apply to business the same tactics which he has used in building the greatest following known in the history of the world. These leaders will come from the rank and ﬁle of the unknown men, who now labor in the steel plants, the coal mines, the automobile factories, and in the small towns and cities of America.</P>
<P class="p16 ft10">Business is due for a reform, make no mistake about this! The methods of the past, based upon economic combinations of FORCE and FEAR, will be supplanted by the better principles of FAITH and cooperation. Men who labor will receive more than daily wages; they will receive dividends from the business, the same as those who supply the capital for business; but, ﬁrst they must GIVE MORE TO THEIR EMPLOYERS, and stop this bickering and bargaining by force, at the expense of the public. They must earn the right to dividends!</P>
<P class="p35 ft10">Moreover, and this is the most important thing of <NOBR>all-THEY</NOBR> WILL BE LED BY LEADERS WHO WILL UNDERSTAND AND APPLY THE PRINCIPLES EM- PLOYED BY MAHATMA GANDHI. Only in this way may leaders get from their followers the spirit of FULL cooperation which constitutes power in its highest and most enduring form.</P>

<P class="p39 ft10">This stupendous machine age in which we live, and from which we are just emerg- ing, has taken the soul out of men. Its leaders have driven men as though they were pieces of cold machinery; they were forced to do so by the employees who have bargained, at the expense of all concerned, to get and not to give.</P>
<P class="p12 ft10">The watchword of the future will be HUMAN HAPPINESS AND CONTENT- MENT, and when this state of mind shall have been attained, the production will take care of itself, more effectively than anything that has ever been accomplished where men did not, and could not mix FAITH and individual interest with their labor.</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">Because of the need for faith and cooperation in operating business and industry, it will be both interesting and proﬁtable to analyze an event which provides an excellent understanding of the method by which industrialists and business men accumulate great fortunes, by giving before they try to get.</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">The event chosen for this illustration dates back to 1900, when the United States Steel Corporation was being formed. As you read the story, keep in mind these fundamental facts and you will understand how IDEAS have been converted into huge fortunes.</P>
<P class="p13 ft12"><SPAN class="ft24">First</SPAN>, the huge United States Steel Corporation was born in the mind of Charles M. Schwab, in the form of an IDEA he created through his IMAGINATION!</P>
<P class="p21 ft8"><SPAN class="ft16">Second</SPAN>, he mixed FAITH with his IDEA.</P>
<P class="p20 ft10"><SPAN class="ft15">Third</SPAN>, he formulated a PLAN for the transformation of his IDEA into physical and ﬁnancial reality.</P>
<P class="p12 ft10"><SPAN class="ft15">Fourth</SPAN>, he put his plan into action with his famous speech at the University Club.</P>
<P class="p12 ft10"><SPAN class="ft15">Fifth</SPAN>, he applied, and <NOBR>followed-through</NOBR> on his PLAN with PERSISTENCE, and backed it with ﬁrm DECISION until it had been fully carried out.</P>
<P class="p40 ft8"><SPAN class="ft16">Sixth</SPAN>, he prepared the way for success by a BURNING DESIRE for success.</P>
<P class="p22 ft10">If you are one of those who have often wondered how great fortunes are accu- mulated, this story of the creation of the United States Steel Corporation will be enlightening. If you have any doubt that men can THINK AND GROW RICH, this story should dispel that doubt, because you can plainly see in the story of the</P>

<P class="p19 ft10">United States Steel, the application of a major portion of the thirteen principles described in this book.</P>
<P class="p12 ft10">This astounding description of the power of an IDEA was dramatically told by John Lowell, in the New York <NOBR>World-Telegram,</NOBR> with whose courtesy it is here reprinted.</P>
<P class="p75 ft16">A PRETTY <NOBR>AFTER-DINNER</NOBR> SPEECH FOR A BILLION DOLLARS</P>
<P class="p33 ft10">“When, on the evening of December 12, 1900, some eighty of the nation’s ﬁnan- cial nobility gathered in the banquet hail of the University Club on Fifth Avenue to do honor to a young man from out of the West, not half a dozen of the guests realized they were to witness the most signiﬁcant episode in American industrial history.</P>
<P class="p14 ft11">“J. Edward Simmons and Charles Stewart Smith, their hearts full of gratitude for the lavish hospitality bestowed on them by Charles M. Schwab during a recent visit to Pittsburgh, had arranged the dinner to introduce the <NOBR>thirty-eight-year-old</NOBR> steel man to eastern banking society. But they didn’t expect him to stampede the convention. They warned him, in fact, that the bosoms within New York’s stuffed shirts would not be responsive to oratory, and that, if he didn’t want to bore the Stilhnans and Harrimans and Vanderbilts, he had better limit himself to ﬁfteen or twenty minutes of polite vaporings and let it go at that.</P>
<P class="p20 ft10">“Even John Pierpont Morgan, sitting on the right hand of Schwab as became his imperial dignity, intended to grace the banquet table with his presence only brief- ly. And so far as the press and public were concerned, the whole affair was of so little moment that no mention of it found its way into print the next day.</P>
<P class="p12 ft10">“So the two hosts and their distinguished guests ate their way through the usual seven or eight courses. There was little conversation and what there was of it was restrained. Few of the bankers and brokers had met Schwab, whose career had ﬂowered along the banks of the Monongahela, and none knew him well. But be- fore the evening was over, <NOBR>they-and</NOBR> with them Money Master Morgan - were to be swept off their feet, and a billion dollar baby, the United States Steel Corporation, was to be conceived.</P>
<P class="p20 ft10">“It is perhaps unfortunate, for the sake of history, that no record of Charlie Schwab’s speech at the dinner ever was made. He repeated some parts of it at a later date during a similar meeting of Chicago bankers. And still later, when the Government brought suit to dissolve the Steel Trust, he gave his own version,</P>

<P class="p34 ft10">from the witness stand, of the remarks that stimulated Morgan into a frenzy of ﬁnancial activity.</P>
<P class="p18 ft11">“It is probable, however, that it was a `homely’ speech, somewhat ungrammatical (for the niceties of language never bothered Schwab), full of epigram and thread- ed with wit. But aside from that it had a galvanic force and effect upon the ﬁve billions of estimated capital that was represented by the diners. After it was over and the gathering was still under its spell, although Schwab had talked for ninety minutes, Morgan led the orator to a recessed window where, dangling their legs from the high, uncomfortable seat, they talked for an hour more.</P>
<P class="p16 ft11">“The magic of the Schwab personality had been turned on, full force, but what was more important and lasting was the <NOBR>full-ﬂedged,</NOBR> <NOBR>clear-cut</NOBR> program he laid down for the aggrandizement of Steel. Many other men had tried to interest Mor- gan in slapping together a steel trust after the pattern of the biscuit, wire and hoop, sugar, rubber, whisky, oil or chewing gum combinations. John W. Gates, the gambler, had urged it, but Morgan distrusted him. The Moore boys, Bill and Jim, Chicago stock jobbers who had glued together a match trust and a cracker corporation, had urged it and failed. Elbert H. Gary, the sanctimonious coun- try lawyer, wanted to foster it, but he wasn’t big enough to be impressive. Until Schwab’s eloquence took J. P. Morgan to the heights from which he could visual- ize the solid results of the most daring ﬁnancial undertaking ever conceived, the project was regarded as a delirious dream of <NOBR>easy-money</NOBR> crackpots.</P>
<P class="p43 ft10">“The ﬁnancial magnetism that began, a generation ago, to attract thousands of small and sometimes inefﬁciently managed companies into large and competi- <NOBR>tion-crushing</NOBR> combinations, had become operative in the steel world through the devices of that jovial business pirate, John W. Gates. Gates already had formed the American Steel and Wire Company out of a chain of small concerns, and to- gether with Morgan had created the Federal Steel Company.</P>
<P class="p35 ft10">The National Tube and American Bridge companies were two more Morgan con- cerns, and the Moore Brothers had forsaken the match and cookie business to form the `American’ group- Tin Plate, Steel Hoop, Sheet <NOBR>Steel-and</NOBR> the National Steel Company.</P>
<P class="p36 ft10">“But by the side of Andrew Carnegie’s gigantic vertical trust, a trust owned and operated by <NOBR>ﬁfty-three</NOBR> partners, those other combinations were picayune. They might combine to their heart’s content but the whole lot of them couldn’t make a dent in the Carnegie organization, and Morgan knew it.</P>

<P class="p15 ft11">“The eccentric old Scot knew it, too. From the magniﬁcent heights of Skibo Castle he had viewed, ﬁrst with amusement and then with resentment, the attempts of Morgan’s smaller companies to cut into his business. When the attempts became too bold, Carnegie’s temper was translated into anger and retaliation. He decided to duplicate every mill owned by his rivals. Hitherto, he hadn’t been interested in wire, pipe, hoops, or sheet. Instead, he was content to sell such companies the raw steel and let them work it into whatever shape they wanted. Now, with Schwab as his chief and able lieutenant, he planned to drive his enemies to the wall.</P>
<P class="p35 ft10">“So it was that in the speech of Charles M. Schwab, Morgan saw the answer to his problem of combination. A trust without <NOBR>Carnegie-giant</NOBR> of them <NOBR>all-would</NOBR> be no trust at all, a plum pudding, as one writer said, without the plums.</P>
<P class="p44 ft10">“Schwab’s speech on the night of December 12, 1900, undoubtedly carried the in- ference, though not the pledge, that the vast Carnegie enterprise could be brought under the Morgan tent.</P>
<P class="p36 ft10">He talked of the world future for steel, of reorganization for efﬁciency, of speciali- zation, of the scrapping of unsuccessful mills and concentration of effort on the ﬂourishing properties, of economies in the ore trafﬁc, of economies in overhead and administrative departments, of capturing foreign markets.</P>
<P class="p44 ft10">“More than that, he told the buccaneers among them wherein lay the errors of their customary piracy. Their purposes, he inferred, bad been to create monopo- lies, raise prices, and pay themselves fat dividends out of privilege. Schwab con- demned the system in his heartiest manner. The shortsightedness of such a poli- cy, he told his hearers, lay in the fact that it restricted the market in an era when everything cried for expansion. By cheapening the cost of steel, he argued, an <NOBR>ever-expanding</NOBR> market would be created; more uses for steel would be devised, and a goodly portion of the world trade could be captured. Actually, though he did not know it, Schwab was an apostle of modern mass production.</P>
<P class="p35 ft10">“So the dinner at the University Club came to an end. Morgan went home, to think about Schwab’s rosy predictions. Schwab went back to Pittsburgh to run the steel business for `Wee Andra Carnegie,’ while Gary and the rest went back to their stock tickers, to ﬁddle around in anticipation of the next move.</P>
<P class="p44 ft10">“It was not long coming. It took Morgan about one week to digest the feast of rea- son Schwab had placed before him. When he had assured himself that no ﬁnancial indigestion was to result, he sent for <NOBR>Schwab-and</NOBR> found that young man rather coy. Mr. Carnegie, Schwab indicated, might not like it if he found his trusted com- pany president had been ﬂirting with the Emperor of Wall Street, the Street upon which Carnegie was resolved never to tread.</P>

<P class="p19 ft10">Then it was suggested by John W. Gates the <NOBR>go-between,</NOBR> that if Schwab `hap- pened’ to be in the Bellevue Hotel in Philadelphia, J. P. Morgan might also `hap- pen’ to be there. When Schwab arrived, however, Morgan was inconveniently ill at his New York home, and so, on the elder man’s pressing invitation, Schwab went to New York and presented himself at the door of the ﬁnancier’s library.</P>
<P class="p14 ft11">“Now certain economic historians have professed the belief that from the begin- ning to the end of the drama, the stage was set by Andrew <NOBR>Carnegie-that</NOBR> the din- ner to Schwab, the famous speech, the Sunday night conference between Schwab and the Money King, were events arranged by the canny Scot. The truth is exactly the opposite. When Schwab was called in to consummate the deal, he didn’t even know whether `the little boss,’ as Andrew was called, would so much as listen to an offer to sell, particularly to a group of men whom Andrew regarded as being endowed with something less than holiness. But Schwab did take into the confer- ence with him, in his own handwriting, six sheets of <NOBR>copper-plate</NOBR> ﬁgures, repre- senting to his mind the physical worth and the potential earning capacity of every steel company he regarded as an essential star in the new metal ﬁrmament.</P>
<P class="p22 ft10">“Four men pondered over these ﬁgures all night. The chief, of course, was Mor- gan, steadfast in his belief in the Divine Right of Money. With him was his aris- tocratic partner, Robert Bacon, a scholar and a gentleman. The third was John W. Gates whom Morgan scorned as a gambler and used as a tool. The fourth was Schwab, who knew more about the processes of making and selling steel than any whole group of men then living. Throughout that conference, the Pittsburgher’s ﬁgures were never questioned. If he said a company was worth so much, then it was worth that much and no more. He was insistent, too, upon including in the combination only those concerns he nominated. He had conceived a corporation in which there would be no duplication, not even to satisfy the greed of friends who wanted to unload their companies upon the broad Morgan shoulders. Thus he left out, by design, a number of the larger concerns upon which the Walruses and Carpenters of Wall Street had cast hungry eyes.</P>
<P class="p58 ft10">“When dawn came, Morgan rose and straightened his back. Only one question remained. “`Do you think you can persuade Andrew Carnegie to sell?’ he asked.</P>
<P class="p40 ft8">“`I can try,’ said Schwab.</P>
<P class="p96 ft8">“`If you can get him to sell, I will undertake the matter,’ said Morgan.</P>
<P class="p33 ft12">“So far so good. But would Carnegie sell? How much would he demand? (Schwab thought about $320,000,000). What would he take payment in? Common or</P>

<P class="p12 ft10">“There was a golf game in January on the <NOBR>frost-cracking</NOBR> heath of the St. Andrews links in Westchester, with Andrew bundled up in sweaters against the cold, and Charlie talking volubly, as usual, to keep his spirits up. But no word of business was mentioned until the pair sat down in the cozy warmth of the Carnegie cot- tage hard by. Then, with the same persuasiveness that had hypnotized eighty mil- lionaires at the University Club, Schwab poured out the glittering promises of retirement in comfort, of untold millions to satisfy the old man’s social caprices. Carnegie capitulated, wrote a ﬁgure on a slip of paper, handed it to Schwab and said, `all right, that’s what we’ll sell for.’</P>
<P class="p33 ft10">“The ﬁgure was approximately $400,000,000, and was reached by taking the $320,000,000 mentioned by Schwab as a basic ﬁgure, and adding to it $80,000,000 to represent the increased capital value over the previous two years.</P>
<P class="p12 ft10">“Later, on the deck of a <NOBR>trans-Atlantic</NOBR> liner, the Scotsman said ruefully to Mor- gan, `I wish I had asked you for $100,000,000 more.’</P>

President Hadley, of Yale, declared that unless trusts were regulated the country might expect `an emperor in Washington within the next <NOBR>twenty-ﬁve</NOBR> years.’ But that able stock manipu- lator, Keene, went at his work of shoving the new stock at the public so vigor- ously that all the excess <NOBR>water-estimated</NOBR> by some at nearly <NOBR>$600,000,000-was</NOBR> absorbed in a twinkling. So Carnegie had his millions, and the Morgan syndicate had $62,000,000 for all its `trouble,’ and all the `boys,’ from Gates to Gary, had their millions.</P>

<P class="p34 ft10">I imagine some readers will question the statement that a mere, intangible DE- SIRE can be converted into its physical equivalent. Doubtless some will say, “You cannot convert NOTHING into SOMETHING!” The answer is in the story of United States</P>
<P class="p36 ft10">Steel. That giant organization was created in the mind of one man. The plan by which the organization was provided with the steel mills that gave it ﬁnancial stability was created in the mind of the same man. His FAITH, his DESIRE, his IMAGINATION, his PERSISTENCE were the real ingredients that went into United States Steel. The steel mills and mechanical equipment acquired by the corporation, AFTER IT HAD BEEN BROUGHT INTO LEGAL EXISTENCE, were incidental, but careful analysis will disclose the fact that the appraised value of the properties acquired by the corporation increased in value by an estimated SIX HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS, by the mere transaction which consolidated them under one management.</P>
<P class="p43 ft10">In other words, Charles M. Schwab’s IDEA, plus the FAITH with which he con- veyed it to the minds of J. P. Morgan and the others, was marketed for a proﬁt of approximately $600,000,000. Not an insigniﬁcant sum for a single IDEA!</P>
<P class="p18 ft10">What happened to some of the men who took their share of the millions of dol- lars of proﬁt made by this transaction, is a matter with which we are not now concerned. The important feature of the astounding achievement is that it serves as unquestionable evidence of the soundness of the philosophy described in this book, because this philosophy was the warp and the woof of the entire transac- tion. Moreover, the practicability of the philosophy has been established by the fact that the United States Steel Corporation prospered, and became one of the richest and most powerful corporations in America, employing thousands of peo- ple, developing new uses for steel, and opening new markets; thus proving that the $600,000,000 in proﬁt which the Schwab IDEA produced was earned.</P>
<P class="p43 ft10">RICHES begin in the form of THOUGHT! The amount is limited only by the per- son in whose mind the THOUGHT is put into motion. FAITH removes limita- tions!</P>
<P class="p36 ft10">Remember this when you are ready to bargain with Life for whatever it is that you ask as your price for having passed this way. Remember, also, that the man who created the United States Steel Corporation was practically unknown at the time. He was merely Andrew Carnegie’s “Man Friday” until he gave birth to his famous IDEA. After that he quickly rose to a position of power, fame, and riches.</P>

<P class="p58 ft10"><NOBR>AUTO-SUGGESTION</NOBR> is a term which applies to all suggestions and all <NOBR>self-ad-</NOBR> ministered stimuli which reach one’s mind through the ﬁve senses. Stated in another way, <NOBR>auto-suggestion</NOBR> is <NOBR>self-suggestion.</NOBR> It is the agency of communica- tion between that part of the mind where conscious thought takes place, and that which serves as the seat of action for the subconscious mind. Through the domi- nating thoughts which one permits to remain in the conscious mind, (whether these thoughts be negative or positive, is immaterial), the principle of <NOBR>auto-sug-</NOBR> gestion voluntarily reaches the subconscious mind and inﬂuences it with these thoughts.</P>

<P class="p103 ft10">SCIOUS MIND WITHOUT THE AID OF THE PRINCIPLE OF <NOBR>AUTO-SUGGES-</NOBR> TION, with the exception of thoughts picked up from the ether. Stated differently, all sense impressions which are perceived through the ﬁve senses, are stopped by the CONSCIOUS thinking mind, and may be either passed on to the subconscious mind, or rejected, at will. The conscious faculty serves, therefore, as an outer- guard to the approach of the subconscious.</P>
<P class="p104 ft10">Nature has so built man that he has ABSOLUTE CONTROL over the material which reaches his subconscious mind, through his ﬁve senses, although this is not meant to be construed as a statement that man always EXERCISES this control. In the great majority of instances, he does NOT exercise it, which explains why so many people go through life in poverty.</P>
<P class="p14 ft10">Recall what has been said about the subconscious mind resembling a fertile gar- den spot, in which weeds will grow in abundance, if the seeds of more desirable crops are not sown therein. AUTOSUGGESTION is the agency of control through which an individual may voluntarily feed his subconscious mind on thoughts of a creative nature, or, by neglect, permit thoughts of a destructive nature to ﬁnd their way into this rich garden of the mind. You were instructed, in the last of the six steps described in the chapter on Desire, to read ALOUD twice daily the WRITTEN statement of your DESIRE FOR MONEY, and to SEE AND FEEL</P>

<P class="p34 ft10">yourself ALREADY in possession of the money! By following these instructions, you communicate the object of your DESIRE directly to your SUBCONSCIOUS mind in a spirit of absolute FAITH.</P>
<P class="p17 ft12">Through repetition of this procedure, you voluntarily create thought habits which are favorable to your efforts to transmute desire into its monetary equivalent.</P>
<P class="p35 ft10">Go back to these six steps described in chapter two, and read them again, very carefully, before you proceed further. Then (when you come to it), read very care- fully the four instructions for the organization of your “Master Mind” group, de- scribed in the chapter on Organized Planning. By comparing these two sets of instructions with that which has been stated on <NOBR>auto-suggestion,</NOBR> you, of course, will see that the instructions involve the application of the principle of <NOBR>auto-sug-</NOBR> gestion.</P>
<P class="p44 ft10">Remember, therefore, when reading aloud the statement of your desire (through which you are endeavoring to develop a “money consciousness”), that the mere reading of the words is of NO <NOBR>CONSEQUENCE-UNLESS</NOBR> you mix emotion, or feeling with your words. If you repeat a million times the famous Emil Coué for- mula, “Day by day, in every way, I am getting better and better,” without mixing emotion and FAITH with your words, you will experience no desirable results. Your subconscious mind recognizes and acts upon ONLY thoughts which have been <NOBR>well-mixed</NOBR> with emotion or feeling.</P>
<P class="p16 ft11">This is a fact of such importance as to warrant repetition in practically every chap- ter, because the lack of understanding of this is the main reason the majority of people who try to apply the principle of <NOBR>auto-suggestion</NOBR> get no desirable results.</P>
<P class="p44 ft10">Plain, unemotional words do not inﬂuence the subconscious mind. You will get no appreciable results until you learn to reach your subconscious mind with thoughts, or spoken words which have been well emotionalized with BELIEF.</P>
<P class="p18 ft10">Do not become discouraged, if you cannot control and direct your emotions the ﬁrst time you try to do so. Remember, there is no such possibility as SOMETHING FOR NOTHING. Ability to reach, and inﬂuence your subconscious mind has its price, and you MUST PAY THAT PRICE. You cannot cheat, even if you desire to do so. The price of ability to inﬂuence your subconscious mind is everlasting PERSISTENCE in applying the principles described here. You cannot develop the desired ability for a lower price. You, and YOU ALONE, must decide whether or not the reward for which you are striving (the “money consciousness”), is worth the price you must pay for it in effort.</P>

<P class="p34 ft10">Wisdom and “cleverness” alone, will not attract and retain money except in a few very rare instances, where the law of averages favors the attraction of money through these sources. The method of attracting money described here, does not depend upon the law of averages. Moreover, the method plays no favorites. It will work for one person as effectively as it will for another. Where failure is experi- enced, it is the individual, not the method, which has failed. If you try and fail, make another effort, and still another, until you succeed.</P>
<P class="p35 ft10">Your ability to use the principle of <NOBR>auto-suggestion</NOBR> will depend, very largely, upon your capacity to CONCENTRATE upon a given DESIRE until that desire becomes a BURNING OBSESSION.</P>
<P class="p36 ft10">When you begin to carry out the instructions in connection with the six steps described in the second chapter, it will be necessary for you to make use of the principle of CONCENTRATION.</P>
<P class="p44 ft10">Let us here offer suggestions for the effective use of concentration. When you begin to carry out the ﬁrst of the six steps, which instructs you to “ﬁx in your own mind the EXACT amount of money you desire,” hold your thoughts on that amount of money by CONCENTRATION, or ﬁxation of attention, with your eyes closed, until you can ACTUALLY SEE the physical appearance of the money. Do this at least once each day. As you go through these exercises, follow the instruc- tions given in the chapter on FAITH, and see yourself actually IN POSSESSION OF THE MONEY!</P>
<P class="p35 ft10">Here is a most signiﬁcant <NOBR>fact-the</NOBR> subconscious mind takes any orders given it in a spirit of absolute FAITH, and acts upon those orders, although the orders often have to be presented over and over again, through repetition, before they are in- terpreted by the subconscious mind. Following the preceding statement, consider the possibility of playing a perfectly legitimate “trick” on your subconscious mind, by making it believe, because you believe it, that you must have the amount of money you are visualizing, that this money is already awaiting your claim, that the subconscious mind MUST hand over to you practical plans for acquiring the money which is yours.</P>
<P class="p16 ft10">Hand over the thought suggested in the preceding paragraph to your IMAGINA- TION, and see what your imagination can, or will do, to create practical plans for the accumulation of money through transmutation of your desire.</P>
<P class="p18 ft11">DO NOT WAIT for a deﬁnite plan, through which you intend to exchange services or merchandise in return for the money you are visualizing, but begin at once to see yourself in possession of the money, DEMANDING and EXPECTING mean-</P>

<P class="p19 ft10">while, that your subconscious mind will hand over the plan, or plans you need. Be on the alert for these plans, and when they appear, put them into ACTION IM- MEDIATELY. When the plans appear, they will probably “ﬂash” into your mind through the sixth sense, in the form of an “inspiration.” This inspiration may be considered a direct “telegram,” or message from Inﬁnite Intelligence. Treat it with respect, and act upon it as soon as you receive it. Failure to do this will be FATAL to your success.</P>
<P class="p20 ft10">In the fourth of the six steps, you were instructed to “Create a deﬁnite plan for carrying out your desire, and begin at once to put this plan into action.” You should follow this instruction in the manner described in the preceding para- graph. Do not trust to your “reason when creating your plan for accumulating money through the transmutation of desire. Your reason is faulty. Moreover, your reasoning faculty may be lazy, and, if you depend entirely upon it to serve you, it may disappoint you.</P>
<P class="p20 ft10">When visualizing the money you intend to accumulate, (with closed eyes), see yourself rendering the service, or delivering the merchandise you intend to give in return for this money. This is important!</P>
<P class="p37 ft16">SUMMARY OF INSTRUCTIONS</P>
<P class="p22 ft11">The fact that you are reading this book is an indication that you earnestly seek knowledge. It is also an indication that you are a student of this subject. If you are only a student, there is a chance that you may learn much that you did not know, but you will learn only by assuming an attitude of humility. If you choose to follow some of the instructions but neglect, or refuse to follow <NOBR>others-you</NOBR> will fail! To get satisfactory results, you must follow ALL instructions in a spirit of FAITH.</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">The instructions given in connection with the six steps in the second chapter will now be summarized, and blended with the principles covered by this chapter, as follows:</P>
<P class="p14 ft10"><SPAN class="ft15">First</SPAN>. Go into some quiet spot (preferably in bed at night) where you will not be disturbed or interrupted, close your eyes, and repeat aloud, (so you may hear your own words) the written statement of the amount of money you intend to ac- cumulate, the time limit for its accumulation, and a description of the service or merchandise you intend to give in return for the money. As you carry out these instructions, SEE YOURSELF ALREADY IN POSSESSION OF THE MONEY.</P>

<P class="p15 ft10">For <NOBR>example :-Suppose</NOBR> that you intend to accumulate $50,000 by the ﬁrst of January, ﬁve years hence, that you intend to give personal services in return for the money, in the Capacity of a salesman. Your written statement of your purpose should be similar to the following:</P>
<P class="p17 ft22">“By the ﬁrst day of January, 19.., I will have in my possession $50,000, which will come to me in various amounts from time to time during the interim.</P>
<P class="p16 ft21">“In return for this money I will give the most efﬁcient service of which I am capable, rendering the fullest possible quantity, and the best possible quality of service in the capacity of salesman of (describe the service or merchandise you intend to sell).</P>
<P class="p17 ft21">“I believe that I will have this money in my possession. My faith is so strong that I can now see this money before my eyes. I can touch it with my hands. It is now awaiting transfer to me at the time, and in the proportion that I deliver the service I intend to render in return for it. I am awaiting a plan by which to accumulate this money, and I will follow that plan, when it is received.”</P>
<P class="p17 ft12"><SPAN class="ft24">Second</SPAN>. Repeat this program night and morning until you can see, (in your im- agination) the money you intend to accumulate.</P>
<P class="p16 ft10"><SPAN class="ft15">Third</SPAN>. Place a written copy of your statement where you can see it night and morning, and read it just before retiring, and upon arising until it has been mem- orized.</P>
<P class="p105 ft10">Remember, as you carry out these instructions, that you are applying the prin- ciple of <NOBR>auto-suggestion,</NOBR> for the purpose of giving orders to your subconscious mind. Remember, also, that your subconscious mind will act ONLY upon instruc- tions which are emotionalized, and handed over to it with “feeling.” FAITH is the strongest, and most productive of the emotions. Follow the instructions given in the chapter on FAITH.</P>
<P class="p17 ft10">These instructions may, at ﬁrst, seem abstract. Do not let this disturb you. Follow the instructions, no matter how abstract or impractical they may, at ﬁrst, appear to be. The time will soon come, if you do as you have been instructed, in spirit as well as in act, when a whole new universe of power will unfold to you.</P>
<P class="p17 ft10">Scepticism, in connection with ALL new ideas, is characteristic of all human be- ings. But if you follow the instructions outlined, your scepticism will soon be re- placed by belief, and this, in turn, will soon become crystallized into ABSOLUTE FAITH. Then you will have arrived at the point where you may truly say, “I am the master of my fate, I am the captain of my soul!”</P>

<P class="p15 ft10">Many philosophers have made the statement, that man is the master of his own earthly destiny, but most of them have failed to say why he is the master. The reason that man may be the master of his own earthly status, and especially his ﬁnancial status, is thoroughly explained in this chapter. Man may become the master of himself, and of his environment, because he has the POWER TO IN- FLUENCE HIS OWN SUBCONSCIOUS MIND, and through it, gain the coopera- tion of Inﬁnite Intelligence.</P>
<P class="p17 ft10">You are now reading the chapter which represents the keystone to the arch of this philosophy. The instructions contained in this chapter must be understood and APPLIED WITH PERSISTENCE, if you succeed in transmuting desire into money.</P>
<P class="p17 ft10">The actual performance of transmuting DESIRE into money, involves the use of <NOBR>auto-suggestion</NOBR> as an agency by which one may reach, and inﬂuence, the sub- conscious mind. The other principles are simply tools with which to apply auto- suggestion. Keep this thought in mind, and you will, at all times, be conscious of the important part the principle of <NOBR>auto-suggestion</NOBR> is to play in your efforts to accumulate money through the methods described in this book. Carry out these instructions as though you were a small child.</P>
<P class="p16 ft10">Inject into your efforts something of the FAITH of a child. The author has been most careful, to see that no impractical instructions were included, because of his sincere desire to be helpful.</P>
<P class="p18 ft12">After you have read the entire book, come back to this chapter, and follow in spirit, and in action, this instruction:</P>
<P class="p16 ft10">READ THE ENTIRE CHAPTER ALOUD ONCE EVERY NIGHT, UNTIL YOU BE- COME THOROUGHLY CONVINCED THAT THE PRINCIPLE OF <NOBR>AUTO-SUG-</NOBR> GESTION IS SOUND, THAT IT WILL ACCOMPLISH FOR YOU ALL THAT HAS BEEN CLAIMED FOR IT.</P>
<P class="p17 ft12">AS YOU READ, UNDERSCORE WITH A PENCIL EVERY SENTENCE WHICH IMPRESSES YOU FAVORABLY.</P>
<P class="p16 ft12">Follow the foregoing instruction to the letter, and it will open the way for a com- plete understanding, and mastery of the principles of success.</P>

<P class="p33 ft10">THERE are two kinds of knowledge. One is general, the other is specialized. Gen- eral knowledge, no matter how great in quantity or variety it may be, is of but little use in the accumulation of money. The faculties of the great universities possess, in the aggregate, practically every form of general knowledge known to civilization. Most of the professors have but little or no money. They specialize on teaching knowledge, but they do not specialize on the organization, or the use of knowledge.</P>
<P class="p20 ft10">KNOWLEDGE will not attract money, unless it is organized, and intelligently directed, through practical PLANS OF ACTION, to the DEFINITE END of ac- cumulation of money. Lack of understanding of this fact has been the source of confusion to millions of people who falsely believe that “knowledge is power.” It is nothing of the sort! Knowledge is only potential power. It becomes power only when, and if, it is organized into deﬁnite plans of action, and directed to a deﬁnite end.</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">This “missing link” in all systems of education known to civilization today, may be found in the failure of educational institutions to teach their students HOW TO ORGANIZE AND USE KNOWLEDGE AFTER THEY ACQUIRE IT.</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">Many people make the mistake of assuming that, because Henry Ford had but little “schooling,” he is not a man of “education.” Those who make this mistake do not know Henry Ford, nor do they understand the real meaning of the word “educate.”</P>
<P class="p12 ft10">That word is derived from the Latin word “educo,” meaning to educe, to draw out, to DEVELOP FROM WITHIN. An educated man is not, necessarily, one who has an abundance of general or specialized knowledge. An educated man is one who has so developed the faculties of his mind that he may acquire anything he wants, or its equivalent, without violating the rights of others. Henry Ford comes well within the meaning of this deﬁnition.</P>

<P class="p19 ft10">During the world war, a Chicago newspaper published certain editorials in which, among other statements, Henry Ford was called “an ignorant paciﬁst.” Mr. Ford objected to the statements, and brought suit against the paper for libeling him. When the suit was tried in the Courts, the attorneys for the paper pleaded justi- ﬁcation, and placed Mr. Ford, himself, on the witness stand, for the purpose of proving to the jury that he was ignorant. The attorneys asked Mr. Ford a great va- riety of questions, all of them intended to prove, by his own evidence, that, while he might possess considerable specialized knowledge pertaining to the manufac- ture of automobiles, he was, in the main, ignorant.</P>
<P class="p96 ft8">Mr. Ford was plied with such questions as the following:</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">“Who was Benedict Arnold?” and “How many soldiers did the British send over to America to put down the Rebellion of 1776?” In answer to the last question, Mr. Ford replied, “I do not know the exact number of soldiers the British sent over, but I have heard that it was a considerably larger number than ever went back.”</P>
<P class="p14 ft10">Finally, Mr. Ford became tired of this line of questioning, and in reply to a par- ticularly offensive question, he leaned over, pointed his ﬁnger at the lawyer who had asked the question, and said, “If I should really WANT to answer the foolish question you have just asked, or any of the other questions you have been asking me, let me remind you that I have a row of electric <NOBR>push-buttons</NOBR> on my desk, and by pushing the right button, I can summon to my aid men who can answer ANY question I desire to ask concerning the business to which I am devoting most of my efforts. Now, will you kindly tell me, WHY I should clutter up my mind with general knowledge, for the purpose of being able to answer questions, when I have men around me who can supply any knowledge I require?”</P>
<P class="p33 ft10">There certainly was good logic to that reply. That answer ﬂoored the lawyer. Every person in the courtroom realized it was the answer, not of an ignorant man, but of a man of EDUCATION. Any man is educated who knows where to get knowledge when he needs it, and how to organize that knowledge into deﬁnite plans of ac- tion. Through the assistance of his “Master Mind” group, Henry Ford had at his command all the specialized knowledge he needed to enable him to become one of the wealthiest men in America. It was not essential that he have this knowledge in his own mind. Surely no person who has sufﬁcient inclination and intelligence to read a book of this nature can possibly miss the signiﬁcance of this illustra- tion.</P>
<P class="p20 ft10">Before you can be sure of your ability to transmute DESIRE into its monetary equivalent, you will require SPECIALIZED KNOWLEDGE of the service, mer- chandise, or profession which you intend to offer in return for fortune. Perhaps</P>

<P class="p19 ft10">you may need much more specialized knowledge than you have the ability or the inclination to acquire, and if this should be true, you may bridge your weakness through the aid of your “Master Mind” group.</P>
<P class="p14 ft11">Andrew Carnegie stated that he, personally, knew nothing about the technical end of the steel business; moreover, he did not particularly care to know anything about it. The specialized knowledge which he required for the manufacture and marketing of steel, he found available through the individual units of his MAS-</P>

<P class="p33 ft10">The accumulation of great fortunes calls for POWER, and power is acquired through highly organized and intelligently directed specialized knowledge, but that knowledge does not, necessarily, have to be in the possession of the man who accumulates the fortune.</P>
<P class="p60 ft10">The preceding paragraph should give hope and encouragement to the man with ambition to accumulate a fortune, who has not possessed himself of the necessary “education” to supply such specialized knowledge as he may require. Men some- times go through life suffering from “inferiority complexes,” because they are not men of “education.” The man who can organize and direct a “Master Mind” group of men who possess knowledge useful in the accumulation of money, is just as much a man of education as any man in the group. REMEMBER THIS, if you suf- fer from a feeling of inferiority, because your schooling has been limited.</P>
<P class="p20 ft10">Thomas A. Edison had only three months of “schooling” during his entire life. He did not lack education, neither did he die poor. Henry Ford had less than a sixth grade “schooling” but he has managed to do pretty well by himself, ﬁnancially.</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">SPECIALIZED KNOWLEDGE is among the most plentiful, and the cheapest forms of service which may be had! If you doubt this, consult the payroll of any university.</P>
<P class="p40 ft8">IT PAYS TO KNOW HOW TO PURCHASE KNOWLEDGE</P>
<P class="p45 ft10">First of all, decide the sort of specialized knowledge you require, and the purpose for which it is needed. To a large extent your major purpose in life, the goal to- ward which you are working, will help determine what knowledge you need.</P>
<P class="p12 ft10">With this question settled, your next move requires that you have accurate in- formation concerning dependable sources of knowledge. The more important of these are:</P>

<P class="p110 ft10">As knowledge is acquired it must be organized and put into use, for a deﬁnite purpose, through practical plans. Knowledge has no value except that which can be gained from its application toward some worthy end. This is one reason why college degrees are not valued more highly. They represent nothing but miscel- laneous knowledge.</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">If you contemplate taking additional schooling, ﬁrst determine the purpose for which you want the knowledge you are seeking, then learn where this particular sort of knowledge can be obtained, from reliable sources.</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">Successful men, in all callings, never stop acquiring specialized knowledge relat- ed to their major purpose, business, or profession. Those who are not successful usually make the mistake of believing that the knowledge acquiring period ends when one ﬁnishes school. The truth is that schooling does but little more than to put one in the way of learning how to acquire practical knowledge.</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">With this Changed World which began at the end of the economic collapse, came also astounding changes in educational requirements. The order of the day is SPECIALIZATION! This truth was emphasized by Robert P. Moore, secretary of appointments of Columbia University.</P>
<P class="p111 ft23">“SPECIALISTS MOST SOUGHT AFTER”</P>
<P class="p58 ft21">“Particularly sought after by employing companies are candidates who have specialized in some <NOBR>ﬁeld-business-school</NOBR> graduates with training in accounting and statistics, engineers of all varieties, journalists, architects, chemists, and also outstanding leaders and activity men of the senior class.</P>
<P class="p13 ft21">“The man who has been active on the campus, whose personality is such that he gets along with all kinds of people and who has done an adequate job with his studies has a most decided edge over the strictly academic student. Some of these, because of their <NOBR>all-around</NOBR> qualiﬁcations, have received several offers of positions, a few of them as many as six.</P>

<P class="p19 ft21">“In departing from the conception that the `straight A’ student was invariably the one to get the choice of the better jobs, Mr. Moore said that most companies look not only to academic records but to activity records and personalities of the students.</P>
<P class="p12 ft21">“One of the largest industrial companies, the leader in its ﬁeld, in writing to Mr. Moore concerning prospective seniors at the college, said:</P>
<P class="p60 ft30">“`We are interested primarily in ﬁnding men who can make exceptional progress in management work. For this reason we emphasize qualities of character, in- telligence and personality far more than speciﬁc educational background.’</P>
<P class="p112 ft16">“APPRENTICESHIP” PROPOSED</P>
<P class="p58 ft10">“Proposing a system of `apprenticing’ students in ofﬁces, stores and industrial occupations during the summer vacation, Mr. Moore asserts that after the ﬁrst two or three years of college, every student should be asked `to choose a deﬁnite future course and to call a halt if he has been merely pleasantly drifting without purpose through an unspecialized academic curriculum.’</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">“Colleges and universities must face the practical consideration that all profes- sions and occupations now demand specialists,” he said, urging that educational institutions accept more direct responsibility for vocational guidance. One of the most reliable and practical sources of knowledge available to those who need specialized schooling, is the night schools operated in most large cities. The cor- respondence schools give specialized training anywhere the U. S. mails go, on all subjects that can be taught by the extension method. One advantage of home study training is the ﬂexibility of the study programme which permits one to study during spare time. Another stupendous advantage of home study training (if the school is carefully chosen), is the fact that most courses offered by home study schools carry with them generous privileges of consultation which can be of priceless value to those needing specialized knowledge. No matter where you live, you can share the beneﬁts.</P>
<P class="p22 ft11">Anything acquired without effort, and without cost is generally unappreciated, often discredited; perhaps this is why we get so little from our marvelous oppor- tunity in public schools. The <NOBR>SELF-DISCIPLINE</NOBR> one receives from a deﬁnite pro- gramme of specialized study makes up to some extent, for the wasted opportunity when knowledge was available without cost. Correspondence schools are highly organized business institutions. Their tuition fees are so low that they are forced</P>

<P class="p34 ft10">to insist upon prompt payments. Being asked to pay, whether the student makes good grades or poor, has the effect of causing one to follow through with the course when he would otherwise drop it. The correspondence schools have not stressed this point sufﬁciently, for the truth is that their collection departments constitute the very ﬁnest sort of training on DECISION, PROMPTNESS, ACTION and THE HABIT OF FINISHING THAT WHICH ONE BEGINS.</P>
<P class="p16 ft10">I learned this from experience, more than <NOBR>twenty-ﬁve</NOBR> years ago. I enrolled for a home study course in Advertising. After completing eight or ten lessons I stopped studying, but the school did not stop sending me bills. Moreover, it insisted upon payment, whether I kept up my studies or not. I decided that if I had to pay for the course (which I had legally obligated myself to do), I should complete the les- sons and get my money’s worth. I felt, at the time, that the collection system of the school was somewhat too well organized, but I learned later in life that it was a valuable part of my training for which no charge had been made. Being forced to pay, I went ahead and completed the course. Later in life I discovered that the efﬁcient collection system of that school had been worth much in the form of money earned, because of the training in advertising I had so reluctantly taken.</P>
<P class="p23 ft10">We have in this country what is said to be the greatest public school system in the world. We have invested fabulous sums for ﬁne buildings, we have provided convenient transportation for children living in the rural districts, so they may attend the best schools, but there is one astounding weakness to this marvelous <NOBR>system-IT</NOBR> IS FREE! One of the strange things about human beings is that they value only that which has a price. The free schools of America, and the free public libraries, do not impress people because they are free. This is the major reason why so many people ﬁnd it necessary to acquire additional training after they quit school and go lo work. It is also one of the major reasons why EMPLOY-</P>
<P class="p113 ft10">ERS GIVE GREATER CONSIDERATION TO EMPLOYEES WHO TAKE HOME STUDY COURSES. They have learned, from experience, that any person who has the ambition to give up a part of his spare time to studying at home has in him those qualities which make for leadership. This recognition is not a charitable gesture, it is sound business judgment upon the part of the employers.</P>
<P class="p44 ft10">There is one weakness in people for which there is no remedy. It is the univer- sal weakness of LACK OF AMBITION! Persons, especially salaried people, who schedule their spare time, to provide for home study, seldom remain at the bot- tom very long. Their action opens the way for the upward climb, removes many obstacles from their path, and gains the friendly interest of those who have the power to put them in the way of OPPORTUNITY.</P>

<P class="p15 ft10">The home study method of training is especially suited to the needs of employed people who ﬁnd, after leaving school, that they must acquire additional special- ized knowledge, but cannot spare the time to go back to school.</P>
<P class="p17 ft10">The changed economic conditions prevailing since the depression have made it necessary for thousands of people to ﬁnd additional, or new sources of income. For the majority of these, the solution to their problem may be found only by ac- quiring specialized knowledge. Many will be forced to change their occupations entirely.</P>
<P class="p17 ft10">When a merchant ﬁnds that a certain line of merchandise is not selling, he usually supplants it with another that is in demand. The person whose business is that of marketing personal services must also be an efﬁcient merchant. If his services do not bring adequate returns in one occupation, he must change to another, where broader opportunities are available.</P>
<P class="p17 ft10">Stuart Austin Wier prepared himself as a Construction Engineer and followed this line of work until the depression limited his market to where it did not give him the income he required. He took inventory of himself, decided to change his profession to law, went back to school and took special courses by which he prepared himself as a corporation lawyer. Despite the fact the depression had not ended, he completed his training, passed the Bar Examination, and quickly built a lucrative law practice, in Dallas, Texas; in fact he is turning away clients.</P>
<P class="p17 ft10">Just to keep the record straight, and to anticipate the alibis of those who will say, “I couldn’t go to school because I have a family to support,” or “I’m too old,” I will add the information that Mr. Wier was past forty, and married when he went back to school. Moreover, by carefully selecting highly specialized courses, in col- leges best prepared to teach the subjects chosen, Mr. Wier completed in two years the work for which the majority of law students require four years. IT PAYS TO KNOW HOW TO PURCHASE KNOWLEDGE!</P>
<P class="p16 ft10">The person who stops studying merely because he has ﬁnished school is forever hopelessly doomed to mediocrity, no matter what may be his calling. The way of success is the way of continuous pursuit of knowledge.</P>
<P class="p18 ft10">Let us consider a speciﬁc instance. During the depression a salesman in a grocery store found himself without a position. Having had some bookkeeping experi- ence, he took a special course in accounting, familiarized himself with all the lat- est bookkeeping and ofﬁce equipment, and went into business for himself. Start- ing with the grocer for whom he had formerly worked, he made contracts with more than 100 small merchants to keep their books, at a very nominal monthly</P>

He now has a ﬂeet of these bookkeeping ofﬁces “on wheels” and employs a large staff of assistants, thus providing small merchants with accounting service equal to the best that money can buy, at very nominal cost.</P>
<P class="p17 ft10">Specialized knowledge, plus imagination, were the ingredients that went into this unique and successful business. Last year the owner of that business paid an in- come tax of almost ten times as much as was paid by the merchant for whom he worked when the depression forced upon him a temporary adversity which proved to be a blessing in disguise.</P>
<P class="p114 ft10">The beginning of this successful business was an IDEA! Inasmuch as I had the privilege of supplying the unemployed salesman with that idea, I now assume the further privilege of suggesting another idea which has within it the possibility of even greater income. Also the possibility of rendering useful service to thousands of people who badly need that service.</P>
<P class="p17 ft10">The idea was suggested by the salesman who gave up selling and went into the business of keeping books on a wholesale basis. When the plan was suggested as a solution of his unemployment problem, he quickly exclaimed, “I like the idea, but I would not know how to turn it into cash.” In other words, he complained he would not know how to market his bookkeeping knowledge after he acquired it.</P>
<P class="p17 ft10">So, that brought up another problem which had to be solved. With the aid of a young woman typist, clever at hand lettering, and who could put the story to- gether, a very attractive book was prepared, describing the advantages of the new system of bookkeeping.</P>
<P class="p17 ft10">The pages were neatly typed and pasted in an ordinary scrapbook, which was used as a silent salesman with which the story of this new business was so effec- tively told that its owner soon had more accounts than he could handle.</P>
<P class="p18 ft10">There are thousands of people, all over the country, who need the services of a merchandising specialist capable of preparing an attractive brief for use in mar- keting personal services. The aggregate annual income from such a service might easily exceed that received by the largest employment agency, and the beneﬁts of the service might be made far greater to the purchaser than any to be obtained from an employment agency.</P>
<P class="p16 ft12">The IDEA here described was born of necessity, to bridge an emergency which had to be covered, but it did not stop by merely serving one person. The wom-</P>

<P class="p19 ft10">an who created the idea has a keen IMAGINATION. She saw in her newly born <NOBR>brain-child</NOBR> the making of a new profession, one that is destined to render valu- able service to thousands of people who need practical guidance in marketing personal services.</P>
<P class="p14 ft11">Spurred to action by the instantaneous success of her ﬁrst “PREPARED PLAN TO MARKET PERSONAL SERVICES,” this energetic woman turned next to the solu- tion of a similar problem for her son who had just ﬁnished college, but had been totally unable to ﬁnd a market for his services. The plan she originated for his use was the ﬁnest specimen of merchandising of personal services I have ever seen.</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">When the plan book had been completed, it contained nearly ﬁfty pages of beauti- fully typed, properly organized information, telling the story of her son’s native ability, schooling, personal experiences, and a great variety of other information too extensive for description. The plan book also contained a complete descrip- tion of the position her son desired, together with a marvelous word picture of the exact plan he would use in ﬁlling the position.</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">The preparation of the plan book required several week’s labor, during which time its creator sent her son to the public library almost daily, to procure data needed in selling his services to best advantage. She sent him, also to all the com- petitors of his prospective employer, and gathered from them vital information concerning their business methods which was of great value in the formation of the plan he intended to use in ﬁlling the position he sought. When the plan had been ﬁnished, it contained more than half a dozen very ﬁne suggestions for the use and beneﬁt of the prospective employer. (The suggestions were put into use by the company).</P>
<P class="p33 ft10">One may be inclined to ask, “Why go to all this trouble to secure a job?” The answer is straight to the point, also it is dramatic, because it deals with a sub- ject which assumes the proportion of a tragedy with millions of men and women whose sole source of income is personal services.</P>
<P class="p40 ft8">The answer is, “DOING A THING WELL NEVER IS TROUBLE! THE PLAN PRE-</P>

<P class="p8 ft8">“Why go to all this trouble?” do you ask?</P>
<P class="p33 ft10">Well, for one thing, the PLANNED PRESENTATION of this young man’s appli- cation for a position clipped off no less than ten years of time he would have required to get to where he began, had he “started at the bottom and worked his way up.”</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">This idea of starting at the bottom and working one’s way up may appear to be sound, but the major objection to it is <NOBR>this-too</NOBR> many of those who begin at the bottom never manage to lift their heads high enough to be seen by OPPORTU- NITY, so they remain at the bottom. It should be remembered, also, that the out- look from the bottom is not so very bright or encouraging. It has a tendency to kill off ambition. We call it “getting into a rut,” which means that we accept our fate because we form the HABIT of daily routine, a habit that ﬁnally becomes so strong we cease to try to throw it off. And that is another reason why it pays to start one or two steps above the bottom. By so doing one forms the HABIT of looking around, of observing how others get ahead, of seeing OPPORTUNITY, and of embracing it without hesitation.</P>
<P class="p33 ft10">Dan Halpin is a splendid example of what I mean. During his college days, he was manager of the famous 1930 National Championship Notre Dame football team, when it was under the direction of the late Knute Rockne.</P>
<P class="p12 ft10">Perhaps he was inspired by the great football coach to aim high, and NOT MIS- TAKE TEMPORARY DEFEAT FOR FAILURE, just as Andrew Carnegie, the great industrial leader, inspired his young business lieutenants to set high goals for themselves. At any rate, young Halpin ﬁnished college at a mighty unfavorable time, when the depression had made jobs scarce, so, after a ﬂing at investment banking and motion pictures, he took the ﬁrst opening with a potential future he could <NOBR>ﬁnd-selling</NOBR> electrical hearing aids on a commission basis. ANYONE COULD START IN THAT SORT OF JOB, AND HALPIN KNEW IT, but it was enough to open the door of opportunity to him.</P>
<P class="p20 ft10">For almost two years, he continued in a job not to his liking, and he would never have risen above that job if he had not done something about his dissatisfaction. He aimed, ﬁrst, at the job of Assistant Sales Manager of his company, and got the job. That one step upward placed him high enough above the crowd to enable him to see still greater opportunity, also, it placed him where OPPORTUNITY COULD SEE HIM.</P>
<P class="p20 ft12">He made such a ﬁne record selling hearing aids, that A. M. Andrews, Chairman of the Board of the Dictograph Products Company, a business competitor of the</P>

<P class="p34 ft10">company for which Halpin worked, wanted to know something about that man Dan Halpin who was taking big sales away from the long established Dictograph Company. He sent for <NOBR>Hal-pin.</NOBR> When the interview was over, Halpin was the new Sales Manager, in charge of the Acousticon Division.</P>
<P class="p44 ft10">Then, to test young Halpin’s metal, Mr. Andrews went away to Florida for three months, leaving him to sink or swim in his new job. He did not sink! Knute Rockne’s spirit of “All the world loves a winner, and has no time for a loser in- spired him to put so much into his job that he was recently elected <NOBR>Vice-President</NOBR> of the company, and General Manager of the Acousticon and Silent Radio Divi- sion, a job which most men would be proud to earn through ten years of loyal effort. Halpin turned the trick in little more than six months.</P>
<P class="p16 ft11">It is difﬁcult to say whether Mr. Andrews or Mr. Halpin is more deserving of eu- logy, for the reason that both showed evidence of having an abundance of that very rare quality known as IMAGINATION. Mr. Andrews deserves credit for see- ing, in young Halpin, a <NOBR>“go-getter”</NOBR> of the highest order. Halpin deserves credit for</P>
<P class="p115 ft10">REFUSING TO COMPROMISE WITH LIFE BY ACCEPTING AND KEEPING A JOB HE DID NOT WANT, and that is one of the major points I am trying to em- phasize through this entire <NOBR>philosophy-that</NOBR> we rise to high positions or remain at the bottom BECAUSE OF CONDITIONS WE CAN CONTROL IF WE DESIRE TO CONTROL THEM.</P>
<P class="p44 ft10">I am also trying to emphasize another point, namely, that both success and failure are largely the results of HABIT! I have not the slightest doubt that Dan Halpin’s close association with the greatest football coach America ever knew, planted in his mind the same brand of DESIRE to excel which made the Notre Dame football team world famous. Truly, there is something to the idea that <NOBR>hero-worship</NOBR> is helpful, provided one worships a WINNER. Halpin tells me that Rockne was one of the world’s greatest leaders of men in all history.</P>
<P class="p35 ft10">My belief in the theory that business associations are vital factors, both in failure and in success, was recently demonstrated, when my son Blair was negotiating with Dan Halpin for a position.</P>
<P class="p36 ft10">Mr. Halpin offered him a beginning salary of about one half what he could have gotten from a rival company. I brought parental pressure to bear, and induced him to accept the place with Mr. Halpin, because I BELIEVE THAT CLOSE AS-</P>
<P class="p115 ft10">SOCIATION WITH ONE WHO REFUSES TO COMPROMISE WITH CIRCUM- STANCES HE DOES NOT LIKE, IS AN ASSET THAT CAN NEVER BE MEAS- URED IN TERMS OF MONEY.</P>

<P class="p15 ft11">The bottom is a monotonous, dreary, unproﬁtable place for any person. That is why I have taken the time to describe how lowly beginnings may be circumvented by proper planning. Also, that is why so much space has been devoted to a de- scription of this new profession, created by a woman who was inspired to do a ﬁne job of PLANNING because she wanted her son to have a favorable “break.”</P>
<P class="p44 ft10">With the changed conditions ushered in by the world economic collapse, came also the need for newer and better ways of marketing PERSONAL SERVICES. It is hard to determine why someone had not previously discovered this stupendous need, in view of the fact that more money changes hands in return for personal services than for any other purpose. The sum paid out monthly, to people who work for wages and salaries, is so huge that it runs into hundreds of millions, and the annual distribution amounts to billions.</P>
<P class="p35 ft10">Perhaps some will ﬁnd, in the IDEA here brieﬂy described, the nucleus of the riches they DESIRE! Ideas with much less merit have been the seedlings from which great fortunes have grown.</P>
<P class="p36 ft10">Woolworth’s Five and Ten Cent Store idea, for example, had far less merit, but it piled up a fortune for its creator. Those seeing OPPORTUNITY lurking in this suggestion will ﬁnd valuable aid in the chapter on Organized Planning.</P>
<P class="p17 ft10">Incidentally, an efﬁcient merchandiser of personal services would ﬁnd a growing demand for his services wherever there are men and women who seek better mar- kets for their services. By applying the Master Mind principle, a few people with suitable talent, could form an alliance, and have a paying business very quickly. One would need to be a fair writer, with a ﬂair for advertising and selling, one handy at typing and hand lettering, and one should be a ﬁrst class business getter who would let the world know about the service. If one person possessed all these abilities, he might carry on the business alone, until it outgrew him.</P>
<P class="p35 ft10">The woman who prepared the “Personal Service Sales Plan” for her son now re- ceives requests from all parts of the country for her cooperation in preparing similar plans for others who desire to market their personal services for more money. She has a staff of expert typists, artists, and writers who have the ability to dramatize the case history so effectively that one’s personal services can be marketed for much more money than the prevailing wages for similar services. She is so conﬁdent of her ability that she accepts, as the major portion of her fee, a percentage of the increased pay she helps her clients to earn.</P>
<P class="p35 ft12">It must not be supposed that her plan merely consists of clever salesmanship by which she helps men and women to demand and receive more money for he</P>

<P class="p42 ft10">The imagination is literally the workshop wherein are fashioned all plans created by man. The impulse, the DESIRE, is given shape, form, and ACTION through the aid of the imaginative faculty of the mind.</P>
<P class="p40 ft8">It has been said that man can create anything which he can imagine.</P>
<P class="p33 ft10">Of all the ages of civilization, this is the most favorable for the development of the imagination, because it is an age of rapid change. On every hand one may contact stimuli which develop the imagination.</P>
<P class="p60 ft10">Through the aid of his imaginative faculty, man has discovered, and harnessed, more of Nature’s forces during the past ﬁfty years than during the entire history of the human race, previous to that time. He has conquered the air so completely, that the birds are a poor match for him in ﬂying. He has harnessed the ether, and made it serve as a means of instantaneous communication with any part of the world. He has analyzed, and weighed the sun at a distance of millions of miles, and has determined, through the aid of IMAGINATION, the elements of which it consists. He has discovered that his own brain is both a broadcasting, and a re- ceiving station for the vibration of thought, and he is beginning now to learn how to make practical use of this discovery. He has increased the speed of locomotion, until he may now travel at a speed of more than three hundred miles an hour.</P>
<P class="p33 ft10">The time will soon come when a man may breakfast in New York, and lunch in San Francisco.</P>
<P class="p12 ft13">MAN’S ONLY LIMITATION, within reason, LIES IN HIS DEVELOPMENT AND USE OF HIS IMAGINATION. He has not yet reached the apex of development in the use of his imaginative faculty. He has merely discovered that he has an imagi- nation, and has commenced to use it in a very elementary way.</P>
<P class="p117 ft16">TWO FORMS OF IMAGINATION</P>
<P class="p45 ft12">The imaginative faculty functions in two forms. One is known as “synthetic imag- ination,” and the other as “creative imagination.” SYNTHETIC IMAGINATION:-</P>

<P class="p15 ft10">Through this faculty, one may arrange old concepts, ideas, or plans into new combinations. This faculty creates nothing. It merely works with the material of experience, education, and observation with which it is fed. It is the faculty used most by the inventor, with the exception of the who draws upon the crea- tive imagination, when he cannot solve his problem through synthetic imagina- tion. CREATIVE <NOBR>IMAGINATION:-Through</NOBR> the faculty of creative imagination, the ﬁnite mind of man has direct communication with Inﬁnite Intelligence. It is the faculty through which “hunches” and “inspirations” are received. It is by this faculty that all basic, or new ideas are handed over to man.</P>
<P class="p23 ft10">It is through this faculty that thought vibrations from the minds of others are received. It is through this faculty that one individual may “tune in,” or commu- nicate with the subconscious minds of other men.</P>
<P class="p18 ft10">The creative imagination works automatically, in the manner described in subse- quent pages. This faculty functions ONLY when the conscious mind is vibrating at an exceedingly rapid rate, as for example, when the conscious mind is stimu- lated through the emotion of a strong desire.</P>
<P class="p17 ft10">The creative faculty becomes more alert, more receptive to vibrations from the sources mentioned, in proportion to its development through USE. This state- ment is signiﬁcant! Ponder over it before passing on.</P>
<P class="p18 ft10">Keep in mind as you follow these principles, that the entire story of how one may convert DESIRE into money cannot be told in one statement. The story will be complete, only when one has MASTERED, ASSIMILATED, and BEGUN TO MAKE USE of all the principles.</P>
<P class="p17 ft10">The great leaders of business, industry, ﬁnance, and the great artists, musicians, poets, and writers became great, because they developed the faculty of creative imagination.</P>
<P class="p18 ft12">Both the synthetic and creative faculties of imagination become more alert with use, just as any muscle or organ of the body develops through use.</P>
<P class="p16 ft10">Desire is only a thought, an impulse. It is nebulous and ephemeral. It is abstract, and of no value, until it has been transformed into its physical counterpart. While the synthetic imagination is the one which will be used most frequently, in the process of transforming the impulse of DESIRE into money, you must keep in mind the fact, that you may face circumstances and situations which demand use of the creative imagination as well.</P>

<P class="p15 ft10">Your imaginative faculty may have become weak through inaction. It can be re- vived and made alert through USE. This faculty does not die, though it may be- come quiescent through lack of use. Center your attention, for the time being, on the development of the synthetic imagination, because this is the faculty which you will use more often in the process of converting desire into money.</P>
<P class="p17 ft10">Transformation of the intangible impulse, of DESIRE, into the tangible reality, of MONEY, calls for the use of a plan, or plans. These plans must be formed with the aid of the imagination, and mainly, with the synthetic faculty.</P>
<P class="p17 ft10">Read the entire book through, then come back to this chapter, and begin at once to put your imagination to work on the building of a plan, or plans, for the trans- formation of your DESIRE into money. Detailed instructions for the building of plans have been given in almost every chapter. Carry out the instructions best suited to your needs, reduce your plan to writing, if you have not already done so. The moment you complete this, you will have DEFINITELY given concrete form to the intangible DESIRE. Read the preceding sentence once more. Read it aloud, very slowly, and as you do so, remember that the moment you reduce the statement of your desire, and a plan for its realization, to writing, you have actu- ally TAKEN THE FIRST of a series of steps, which will enable you to convert the thought into its physical counterpart.</P>
<P class="p23 ft10">The earth on which you live, you, yourself, and every other material thing are the result of evolutionary change, through which microscopic bits of matter have been organized and arranged in an orderly fashion.</P>
<P class="p18 ft10"><NOBR>Moreover-and</NOBR> this statement is of stupendous <NOBR>importance-this</NOBR> earth, every one of the billions of individual cells of your body, and every atom of matter, began as an intangible form of energy. DESIRE is thought impulse! Thought impulses are forms of energy. When you begin with the thought impulse, DESIRE, to accumu- late money, you are drafting into your service the same “stuff” that Nature used in creating this earth, and every material form in the universe, including the body and brain in which the thought impulses function.</P>
<P class="p16 ft10">As far as science has been able to determine, the entire universe consists of but two <NOBR>elements-matter</NOBR> and energy. Through the combination of energy and matter, has been created everything perceptible to man, from the largest star which ﬂoats in the heavens, down to, and including man, himself.</P>
<P class="p18 ft10">You are now engaged in the task of trying to proﬁt by Nature’s method. You are (sincerely and earnestly, we hope), trying to adapt yourself to Nature’s laws, by endeavoring to convert DESIRE into its physical or monetary equivalent. YOU</P>

<P class="p8 ft8">CAN DO IT! IT HAS BEEN DONE BEFORE!</P>
<P class="p22 ft10">You can build a fortune through the aid of laws which are immutable. But, ﬁrst, you must become familiar with these laws, and learn to USE them. Through rep- etition, and by approaching the description of these principles from every con- ceivable angle, the author hopes to reveal to you the secret through which every great fortune has been accumulated. Strange and paradoxical as it may seem, the “secret” is NOT A SECRET. Nature, herself, advertises it in the earth on which we live, the stars, the planets suspended within our view, in the elements above and around us, in every blade of grass, and every form of life within our vision.</P>
<P class="p20 ft10">Nature advertises this “secret” in the terms of biology, in the conversion of a tiny cell, so small that it may be lost on the point of a pin, into the HUMAN BEING now reading this line. The conversion of desire into its physical equivalent is, cer- tainly, no more miraculous!</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">Do not become discouraged if you do not fully comprehend all that has been stat- ed. Unless you have long been a student of the mind, it is not to be expected that you will assimilate all that is in this chapter upon a ﬁrst reading.</P>
<P class="p12 ft10">But you will, in time, make good progress. The principles which follow will open the way for understanding of imagination. Assimilate that which you understand, as you read this philosophy for the ﬁrst time, then, when you reread and study it, you will discover that something has happened to clarify it, and give you a broader understanding of the whole. Above all, DO NOT STOP, nor hesitate in your study of these principles until you have read the book at least THREE times, for then, you will not want to stop.</P>
<P class="p118 ft16">HOW TO MAKE PRACTICAL USE OF IMAGINATION</P>
<P class="p97 ft10">Ideas are the beginning points of all fortunes. Ideas are products of the imagina- tion. Let us examine a few well known ideas which have yielded huge fortunes, with the hope that these illustrations will convey deﬁnite information concerning the method by which imagination may be used in accumulating riches.</P>
<P class="p75 ft16">THE ENCHANTED KETTLE</P>
<P class="p119 ft10">Fifty years ago, an old country doctor drove to town, hitched his horse, quietly slipped into a drug store by the back door, and began “dickering” with the young drug clerk. His mission was destined to yield great wealth to many people. It was destined to bring to the South the most <NOBR>far-ﬂung</NOBR> beneﬁt since the Civil War.</P>

<P class="p15 ft10">For more than an hour, behind the prescription counter, the old doctor and the clerk talked in low tones. Then the doctor left. He went out to the buggy and brought back a large, old fashioned kettle, a big wooden paddle (used for stirring the contents of the kettle), and deposited them in the back of the store.</P>
<P class="p18 ft10">The clerk inspected the kettle, reached into his inside pocket, took out a roll of bills, and handed it over to the doctor. The roll contained exactly <NOBR>$500.00-the</NOBR> clerk’s entire savings! The doctor handed over a small slip of paper on which was written a secret formula. The words on that small slip of paper were worth a King’s ransom! But not to the doctor! Those magic words were needed to start the kettle to boiling, but neither the doctor nor the young clerk knew what fabulous fortunes were destined to ﬂow from that kettle.</P>
<P class="p16 ft10">The old doctor was glad to sell the outﬁt for ﬁve hundred dollars. The money would pay off his debts, and give him freedom of mind. The clerk was taking a big chance by staking his entire life’s savings on a mere scrap of paper and an old kettle! He never dreamed his investment would start a kettle to overﬂowing with gold that would surpass the miraculous performance of Aladdin’s lamp. What the clerk really purchased was an IDEA! The old kettle and the wooden paddle, and the secret message on a slip of paper were incidental. The strange performance of that kettle began to take place after the new owner mixed with the secret instruc- tions an ingredient of which the doctor knew nothing.</P>
<P class="p16 ft10">Read this story carefully, give your imagination a test! See if you can discover what it was that the young man added to the secret message, which caused the kettle to overﬂow with gold. Remember, as you read, that this is not a story from Arabian Nights. Here you have a story of facts, stranger than ﬁction, facts which began in the form of an IDEA.</P>
<P class="p17 ft10">Let us take a look at the vast fortunes of gold this idea has produced. It has paid, and still pays huge fortunes to men and women all over the world, who distribute the contents of the kettle to millions of people.</P>
<P class="p17 ft10">The Old Kettle is now one of the world’s largest consumers of sugar, thus provid- ing jobs of a permanent nature to thousands of men and women engaged in grow- ing sugar cane, and in reﬁning and marketing sugar.</P>
<P class="p18 ft10">The Old Kettle consumes, annually, millions of glass bottles, providing jobs to huge numbers of glass workers. The Old Kettle gives employment to an army of clerks, stenographers, copy writers, and advertising experts throughout the na- tion. It has brought fame and fortune to scores of artists who have created mag- niﬁcent pictures describing the product.</P>

<P class="p15 ft10">The Old Kettle has converted a small Southern city into the business capital of the South, where it now beneﬁts, directly, or indirectly, every business and practically every resident of the city.</P>
<P class="p18 ft10">The inﬂuence of this idea now beneﬁts every civilized country in the world, pour- ing out a continuous stream of gold to all who touch it. Gold from the kettle built and maintains one of the most prominent colleges of the South, where thousands of young people receive the training essential for success.</P>
<P class="p17 ft10">The Old Kettle has done other marvelous things. All through the world depres- sion, when factories, banks and business houses were folding up and quitting by the thousands, the owner of this Enchanted Kettle went marching on, giving con- tinuous employment to an army of men and women all over the world, and pay- ing out extra portions of gold to those who, long ago, had faith in the idea. If the product of that old brass kettle could talk, it would tell thrilling tales of romance in every language. Romances of love, romances of business, romances of profes- sional men and women who are daily being stimulated by it.</P>
<P class="p16 ft10">The author is sure of at least one such romance, for he was a part of it, and it all began not far from the very spot on which the drug clerk purchased the old kettle. It was here that the author met his wife, and it was she who ﬁrst told him of the Enchanted Kettle.</P>
<P class="p18 ft10">It was the product of that Kettle they were drinking when he asked her to accept him “for better or worse.”</P>
<P class="p18 ft10">Now that you know the content of the Enchanted Kettle is a world famous drink, it is ﬁtting that the author confess that the home city of the drink supplied him with a wife, also that the drink itself provides him with stimulation of thought without intoxication, and thereby it serves to give the refreshment of mind which an author must have to do his best work.</P>
<P class="p17 ft10">Whoever you are, wherever you may live, whatever occupation you may be en- gaged in, just remember in the future, every time you see the words <NOBR>“Coca-Cola,”</NOBR> that its vast empire of wealth and inﬂuence grew out of a single IDEA, and that the mysterious ingredient the drug <NOBR>clerk-Asa</NOBR> <NOBR>Candler-mixed</NOBR> with the secret for- mula was. . .

<P class="p17 ft10">Stop and think of that, for a moment. Remember, also, that the thirteen steps to riches, described in this book, were the media through which the inﬂuence of <NOBR>Coca-Cola</NOBR> has been extended to every city, town, village, and <NOBR>cross-roads</NOBR> of the</P>

<P class="p46 ft8">Truly, thoughts are things, and their scope of operation is the world, itself.</P>
<P class="p120 ft16">WHAT I WOULD DO IF I HAD A MILLION DOLLARS</P>
<P class="p76 ft10">This story proves the truth of that old saying, “where there’s a will, there’s a way.” It was told to me by that beloved educator and clergyman, the late Frank W. Gunsaulus, who began his preaching career in the stockyards region of South Chicago.</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">While Dr. Gunsaulus was going through college, he observed many defects in our educational system, defects which he believed he could correct, if he were the head of a college. His deepest desire was to become the directing head of an educational institution in which young men and women would be taught to “learn by doing.”</P>
<P class="p13 ft12">He made up his mind to organize a new college in which he could carry out his ideas, without being handicapped by orthodox methods of education.</P>
<P class="p20 ft10">He needed a million dollars to put the project across! Where was he to lay his hands on so large a sum of money? That was the question that absorbed most of this ambitious young preacher’s thought.</P>
<P class="p12 ft10">But he couldn’t seem to make any progress. Every night he took that thought to bed with him. He got up with it in the morning. He took it with him everywhere he went. He turned it over and over in his mind until it became a consuming ob- session with him. A million dollars is a lot of money. He recognized that fact, but he also recognized the truth that the only limitation is that which one sets up in one’s own mind.</P>
<P class="p20 ft10">Being a philosopher as well as a preacher, Dr. Gunsaulus recognized, as do all who succeed in life, that DEFINITENESS OF PURPOSE is the starting point from which one must begin. He recognized, too, that deﬁniteness of purpose takes on animation, life, and power when backed by a BURNING DESIRE to translate that purpose into its material equivalent.</P>
<P class="p14 ft17">He knew all these great truths, yet he did not know where, or how to lay his hands on a million dollars. The natural procedure would have been to give up and quit,</P>

<P class="p19 ft10">by saying, “Ah well, my idea is a good one, but I cannot do anything with it, be- cause I never can procure the necessary million dollars.” That is exactly what the majority of people would have said, but it is not what Dr. Gunsaulus said. What he said, and what he did are so important that I now introduce him, and let him speak for himself.</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">“One Saturday afternoon I sat in my room thinking of ways and means of raising the money to carry out my plans. For nearly two years, I had been thinking, but I had done nothing but think!</P>
<P class="p46 ft8">“The time had come for ACTION!”</P>
<P class="p20 ft10">“I made up my mind, then and there, that I would get the necessary million dol- lars within a week. How? I was not concerned about that. The main thing of im- portance was the decision to get the money within a speciﬁed time, and I want to tell you that the moment I reached a deﬁnite decision to get the money within a speciﬁed time, a strange feeling of assurance came over me, such as I had never before experienced. Something inside me seemed to say, `Why didn’t you reach that decision a long time ago? The money was waiting for you all the time!’</P>
<P class="p20 ft10">“Things began to happen in a hurry. I called the newspapers and announced I would preach a sermon the following morning, entitled, `What I would do if I had a Million Dollars.’</P>
<P class="p12 ft10">“I went to work on the sermon immediately, but I must tell you, frankly, the task was not difﬁcult, because I had been preparing that sermon for almost two years. The spirit back of it was a part of me!</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">“Long before midnight I had ﬁnished writing the sermon. I went to bed and slept with a feeling of conﬁdence, for I could see myself already in. possession of the million dollars.</P>
<P class="p12 ft10">“Next morning I arose early, went into the bathroom, read the sermon, then knelt on my knees and asked that my sermon might come to the attention of someone who would supply the needed money.</P>
<P class="p12 ft10">“While I was praying I again had that feeling of assurance that the money would be forthcoming. In my excitement, I walked out without my sermon, and did not discover the oversight until I was in my pulpit and about ready to begin deliver- ing it.</P>

<P class="p15 ft10">“It was too late to go back for my notes, and what a blessing that I couldn’t go back! Instead, my own subconscious mind yielded the material I needed. When I arose to begin my sermon, I closed my eyes, and spoke with all my heart and soul of my dreams. I not only talked to my audience, but I fancy I talked also to God. I told what I would do with a million dollars if that amount were placed in my hands. I described the plan I had in mind for organizing a great educational in- stitution, where young people would learn to do practical things, and at the same time develop their minds.</P>
<P class="p16 ft10">“When I had ﬁnished and sat down, a man slowly arose from his seat, about three rows from the rear, and made his way toward the pulpit. I wondered what he was going to do. He came into the pulpit, extended his hand, and said, `Reverend, I liked your sermon. I believe you can do everything you said you would, if you had a million dollars. To prove that I believe in you and your sermon, if you will come to my ofﬁce tomorrow morning, I will give you the million dollars. My name is Phillip D. Armour.”’</P>
<P class="p16 ft12">Young Gunsaulus went to Mr. Armour’s ofﬁce and the million dollars was pre- sented to him. With the money, he founded the Armour Institute of Technology.</P>
<P class="p16 ft10">That is more money than the majority of preachers ever see in an entire lifetime, yet the thought impulse back of the money was created m the young preacher’s mind in a fraction of a minute. The necessary million dollars came as a result of an idea. Back of the idea was a DESIRE which young Gunsaulus had been nursing in his mind for almost two years.</P>
<P class="p17 ft10">Observe this important fact... HE GOT THE MONEY WITHIN <NOBR>THIRTY-SIX</NOBR> HOURS AFTER HE REACHED A DEFINITE DECISION IN HIS OWN MIND TO GET IT, AND DECIDED UPON A DEFINITE PLAN FOR GETTING IT!</P>
<P class="p18 ft10">There was nothing new or unique about young Gunsaulus’ vague thinking about a million dollars, and weakly hoping for it. Others before him, and many since his time, have had similar thoughts. But there was something very unique and different about the decision he reached on that memorable Saturday, when he put vagueness into the background, and deﬁnitely said, “I WILL get that money within a week!”</P>
<P class="p16 ft10">God seems to throw Himself on the side of the man who knows exactly what he wants, if he is determined to get JUST THAT! Moreover, the principle through which Dr. Gunsaulus got his million dollars is still alive! It is available to you! This universal law is as workable today as it was when the young preacher made use of it so successfully. This book describes, step by step, the thirteen elements</P>

<P class="p19 ft10">of this great law, and suggests how they may be put to use. Observe that Asa Can- dler and Dr. Frank Gunsaulus had one characteristic in common. Both knew the astounding truth that IDEAS CAN BE TRANSMUTED INTO CASH THROUGH THE POWER OF DEFINITE PURPOSE, PLUS DEFINITE PLANS.</P>
<P class="p13 ft12">If you are one of those who believe that hard work and honesty, alone, will bring riches, perish the thought! It is not true!</P>
<P class="p20 ft10">Riches, when they come in huge quantities, are never the result of HARD work! Riches come, if they come at all, in response to deﬁnite demands, based upon the application of deﬁnite principles, and not by chance or luck. Generally speaking, an idea is an impulse of thought that impels action, by an appeal to the imagina- tion. All master salesmen know that ideas can be sold where merchandise cannot. Ordinary salesmen do not know <NOBR>this-that</NOBR> is why they are “ordinary”.</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">A publisher of books, which sell for a nickel, made a discovery that should be worth much to publishers generally. He learned that many people buy titles, and not contents of books. By merely changing the name of one book that was not moving, his sales on that book jumped upward more than a million copies. The inside of the book was not changed in any way. He merely ripped off the cover bearing the title that did not sell, and put on a new cover with a title that had <NOBR>“box-ofﬁce”</NOBR> value.</P>
<P class="p21 ft8">That, as simple as it may seem, was an IDEA! It was IMAGINATION.</P>
<P class="p33 ft10">There is no standard price on ideas. The creator of ideas makes his own price, and, if he is smart, gets it. The moving picture industry created a whole ﬂock of millionaires. Most of them were men who couldn’t create <NOBR>ideas-BUT-they</NOBR> had the imagination to recognize ideas when they saw them. The next ﬂock of mil- lionaires will grow out of the radio business, which is new and not overburdened with men of keen imagination. The money will be made by those who discover or create new and more meritorious radio programmes and have the imagination to recognize merit, and to give the radio listeners a chance to proﬁt by it.</P>
<P class="p20 ft10">The sponsor! That unfortunate victim who now pays the cost of all radio “en- tertainment,” soon will become idea conscious, and demand something for his money. The man who beats the sponsor to the draw, and supplies programmes that render useful service, is the man who will become rich in this new industry.</P>
<P class="p12 ft10">Crooners and light chatter artists who now pollute the air with wisecracks and sil- ly giggles, will go the way of all light timbers, and their places will be taken by real artists who interpret carefully planned programmes which have been designed to service the minds of men, as well as provide entertainment.</P>

<P class="p15 ft10">Here is a wide open ﬁeld of opportunity screaming its protest at the way it is be- ing butchered, because of lack of imagination, and begging for rescue at any price. Above all, the thing that radio needs is new IDEAS!</P>
<P class="p18 ft10">If this new ﬁeld of opportunity intrigues you, perhaps you might proﬁt by the suggestion that the successful radio programmes of the future will give more at- tention to creating “buyer” audiences, and less attention to “listener” audiences. Stated more plainly, the builder of radio programmes who succeeds in the future, must ﬁnd practical ways to convert “listeners” into “buyers.”</P>
<P class="p17 ft12">Moreover, the successful producer of radio programmes in the future must key his features so that he can deﬁnitely show its effect upon the audience.</P>
<P class="p16 ft10">Sponsors are becoming a bit weary of buying glib selling talks, based upon state- ments grabbed out of thin air. They want, and in the future will demand, indis- putable proof that the Whoosit programme not only gives millions of people the silliest giggle ever, but that the silly giggler can sell merchandise!</P>
<P class="p17 ft10">Another thing that might as well be understood by those who contemplate enter- ing this new ﬁeld of opportunity, radio advertising is going to be handled by an entirely new group of advertising experts, separate and distinct from the old time newspaper and magazine advertising agency men. The old timers in the advertis- ing game cannot read the modern radio scripts, because they have been schooled to SEE ideas. The new radio technique demands men who can interpret ideas from a written manuscript in terms of SOUND! It cost the author a year of hard labor, and many thousands of dollars to learn this.</P>
<P class="p16 ft12">Radio, right now, is about where the moving pictures were, when Mary Pickford and her curls ﬁrst appeared on the screen.</P>
<P class="p16 ft10">There is plenty of room in radio for those who can produce or recognize IDEAS. If the foregoing comment on the opportunities of radio has not started your idea factory to work, you had better forget it. Your opportunity is in some other ﬁeld. If the comment intrigued you in the slightest degree, then go further into it, and you may ﬁnd the one IDEA you need to round out your career.</P>
<P class="p17 ft10">Never let it discourage you if you have no experience in radio. Andrew Carnegie knew very little about making <NOBR>steel-I</NOBR> have Carnegie’s own word for <NOBR>this-but</NOBR> he made practical use of two of the principles described in this book, and made the steel business yield him a fortune.</P>

<P class="p121 ft10">The story of practically every great fortune starts with the day when a creator of ideas and a seller of ideas got together and worked in harmony. Carnegie sur- rounded himself with men who could do all that he could not do. Men who cre- ated ideas, and men who put ideas into operation, and made himself and the others fabulously rich.</P>
<P class="p17 ft10">Millions of people go through life hoping for favorable “breaks.” Perhaps a favo- rable break can get one an opportunity, but the safest plan is not to depend upon luck. It was a favorable “break” that gave me the biggest opportunity of my life- <NOBR>but-twenty-ﬁve</NOBR> years of determined effort had to be devoted to that opportunity before it became an asset.</P>
<P class="p17 ft10">The “break” consisted of my good fortune in meeting and gaining the coopera- tion of Andrew Carnegie. On that occasion Carnegie planted in my mind the idea of organizing the principles of achievement into a philosophy of success. Thou- sands of people have proﬁted by the discoveries made in the <NOBR>twenty-ﬁve</NOBR> years of research, and several fortunes have been accumulated through the application of the philosophy. The beginning was simple. It was an IDEA which anyone might have developed.</P>
<P class="p16 ft10">The favorable break came through Carnegie, but what about the DETERMINA- TION, DEFINITENESS OF PURPOSE, and the DESIRE TO ATTAIN THE GOAL, and the PERSISTENT EFFORT OF <NOBR>TWENTY-FIVE</NOBR> YEARS? It was no ordinary DESIRE that survived disappointment, discouragement, temporary defeat, criti- cism, and the constant reminding of “waste of time.” It was a BURNING DESIRE! AN OBSESSION!</P>
<P class="p17 ft10">When the idea was ﬁrst planted in my mind by Mr. Carnegie, it was coaxed, nursed, and enticed to remain alive. Gradually, the idea became a giant under its own power, and it coaxed, nursed, and drove me. Ideas are like that. First you give life and action and guidance to ideas, then they take on power of their own and sweep aside all opposition.</P>
<P class="p17 ft10">Ideas are intangible forces, but they have more power than the physical brains that give birth to them. They have the power to live on, after the brain that cre- ates them has returned to dust. For example, take the power of Christianity. That began with a simple idea, born in the brain of Christ. Its chief tenet was, “do unto others as you would have others do unto you.” Christ has gone back to the source from whence He came, but His IDEA goes marching on.</P>
<P class="p16 ft10">Some day, it may grow up, and come into its own, then it will have fulﬁlled Christ’s deepest DESIRE. The IDEA has been developing only two thousand years. Give it time!</P>

<P class="p97 ft10">You have learned that everything man creates or acquires, begins in the form of DESIRE, that desire is taken on the ﬁrst lap of its journey, from the abstract to the concrete, into the workshop of the IMAGINATION, where PLANS for its transi- tion are created and organized.</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">In Chapter two, you were instructed to take six deﬁnite, practical steps, as your ﬁrst move in translating the desire for money into its monetary equivalent. One of these steps is the formation of a DEFINITE, practical plan, or plans, through which this transformation may be made. You will now be instructed how to build plans which will be practical, viz:-</P>
<P class="p125 ft10"><SPAN class="ft8">(a)</SPAN><SPAN class="ft29">Ally yourself with a group of as many people as you may need for the crea- tion, and carrying out of your plan, or plans for the accumulation of </SPAN><NOBR>money-mak-</NOBR> ing use of the “Master Mind” principle described in a later chapter. (Compliance with this instruction is absolutely essential. Do not neglect it.)</P>
<P class="p126 ft10"><SPAN class="ft8">(b)</SPAN><SPAN class="ft31">Before forming your “Master Mind” alliance, decide what advantages, and beneﬁts, you may offer the individual embers of your group, in return for their cooperation. No one will work indeﬁnitely without some form of compensation. No intelligent person will either request or expect another to work without ad- equate compensation, although this may not always be in the form of money.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p127 ft10"><SPAN class="ft8">(c)</SPAN><SPAN class="ft32">Arrange to meet with the members of your “Master Mind” group at least twice a week, and more often if possible, until you have jointly perfected the nec- essary plan, or plans for the accumulation of money.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p128 ft10"><SPAN class="ft8">(d)</SPAN><SPAN class="ft32">Maintain PERFECT HARMONY between yourself and every member of your “Master Mind” group.

<P class="p8 ft8">Keep in mind these facts:-</P>
<P class="p42 ft12"><SPAN class="ft24">First</SPAN>. You are engaged in an undertaking of major importance to you. To be sure of success, you must have plans which are faultless.</P>
<P class="p129 ft10"><SPAN class="ft15">Second</SPAN>. You must have the advantage of the experience, education, native abil- ity and imagination of other minds. This is in harmony with the methods followed by every person who has accumulated a great fortune.</P>
<P class="p130 ft10">No individual has sufﬁcient experience, education, native ability, and knowledge to insure the accumulation of a great fortune, without the cooperation of other people. Every plan you adopt, in your endeavor to accumulate wealth, should be the joint creation of yourself and every other member of your “Master Mind” group. You may originate your own plans, either in whole or in part, but SEE THAT THOSE PLANS ARE CHECKED, AND APPROVED BY THE MEMBERS OF YOUR “MASTER MIND” ALLIANCE.</P>
<P class="p20 ft10">If the ﬁrst plan which you adopt does not work successfully, replace it with a new plan, if this new plan fails to work, replace it, in turn with still another, and so on, until you ﬁnd a plan which DOES WORK. Right here is the point at which the ma- jority of men meet with failure, because of their lack of PERSISTENCE in creating new plans to take the place of those which fail.</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">The most intelligent man living cannot succeed in accumulating <NOBR>money-nor</NOBR> in any other <NOBR>undertaking-without</NOBR> plans which are practical and workable. Just keep this fact in mind, and remember when your plans fail, that temporary defeat is not permanent failure. It may only mean that your plans have not been sound. Build other plans. Start all over again.</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">Thomas A. Edison “failed” ten thousand times before he perfected the incandes- cent electric light bulb. That <NOBR>is-he</NOBR> met with temporary defeat ten thousand times, before his efforts were crowned with success.</P>
<P class="p12 ft10">Temporary defeat should mean only one thing, the certain knowledge that there is something wrong with your plan. Millions of men go through life in misery and poverty, because they lack a sound plan through which to accumulate a fortune.</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">Henry Ford accumulated a fortune, not because of his superior mind, but because he adopted and followed a PLAN which proved to be sound. A thousand men could be pointed out, each with a better education than Ford’s, yet each of whom lives in poverty, because he does not possess the RIGHT plan for the accumula- tion of money.</P>

<P class="p19 ft10">Your achievement can be no greater than your PLANS are sound. That may seem to be an axiomatic statement, but it is true. Samuel Insull lost his fortune of over one hundred million dollars.</P>
<P class="p12 ft10">The Insull fortune was built on plans which were sound. The business depression forced Mr. Insull to CHANGE HIS PLANS; and the CHANGE brought “tempo- rary defeat,” because his new plans were NOT SOUND. Mr. Insull is now an old man, he may, consequently, accept “failure” instead of “temporary defeat,” but if his experience turns out to be FAILURE, it will be for the reason that he lacks the ﬁre of PERSISTENCE to rebuild his plans.</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">No man is ever whipped, until he <NOBR>QUITS-in</NOBR> his own mind. This fact will be re- peated many times, because it is so easy to “take the count” at the ﬁrst sign of defeat.</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">James J. Hill met with temporary defeat when he ﬁrst endeavored to raise the necessary capital to build a railroad from the East to the West, but he, too turned defeat into victory through new plans.</P>
<P class="p12 ft10">Henry Ford met with temporary defeat, not only at the beginning of his automo- bile career, but after he had gone far toward the top. He created new plans, and went marching on to ﬁnancial victory.</P>
<P class="p12 ft10">We see men who have accumulated great fortunes, but we often recognize only their triumph, overlooking the temporary defeats which they had to surmount before “arriving”.</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">NO FOLLOWER OF THIS PHILOSOPHY CAN REASONABLY EXPECT TO AC- CUMULATE A FORTUNE WITHOUT EXPERIENCING “TEMPORARY DE- FEAT.” When defeat comes, accept it as a signal that your plans are not sound, rebuild those plans, and set sail once more toward your coveted goal. If you give up before your goal has been reached, you are a “quitter.”</P>
<P class="p131 ft16">A QUITTER NEVER <NOBR>WINS-AND-A</NOBR> WINNER NEVER QUITS.</P>
<P class="p20 ft10">Lift this sentence out, write it on a piece of paper in letters an inch high, and place it where you will see it every night before you go to sleep, and every morning be- fore you go to work.</P>
<P class="p13 ft12">When you begin to select members for your “Master Mind” group, endeavor to select those who do not take defeat seriously. Some people foolishly believe that</P>

<P class="p19 ft10">only MONEY can make money. This is not true! DESIRE, transmuted into its monetary equivalent, through the principles laid down here, is the agency through which money is “made.” Money, of itself, is nothing but inert matter. It cannot move, think, or talk, but it can “hear” when a man who DESIRES it, calls it to come!</P>
<P class="p118 ft16">PLANNING THE SALE OF SERVICES</P>
<P class="p119 ft10">The remainder of this chapter has been given over to a description of ways and means of marketing personal services. The information here conveyed will be of practical help to any person having any form of personal services to market, but it will be of priceless beneﬁt to those who aspire to leadership in their chosen oc- cupations.</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">Intelligent planning is essential for success in any undertaking designed to accu- mulate riches. Here will be found detailed instructions to those who must begin the accumulation of riches by selling personal services.</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">It should be encouraging to know that practically all the great fortunes began in the form of compensation for personal services, or from the sale of IDEAS. What else, except ideas and personal services, would one not possessed of property have to give in return for riches?</P>
<P class="p12 ft10">Broadly speaking, there are two types of people in the world. One type is known as LEADERS, and the other as FOLLOWERS. Decide at the outset whether you intend to become a leader in your chosen calling, or remain a follower. The differ- ence in compensation is vast. The follower cannot reasonably expect the compen- sation to which a leader is entitled, although many followers make the mistake of expecting such pay.</P>
<P class="p20 ft10">It is no disgrace to be a follower. On the other hand, it is no credit to remain a fol- lower. Most great leaders began in the capacity of followers. They became great leaders because they were INTELLIGENT FOLLOWERS. With few exceptions, the man who cannot follow a leader intelligently, cannot become an efﬁcient leader. The man who can follow a leader most efﬁciently, is usually the man who develops into leadership most rapidly. An intelligent follower has many advan- tages, among them the OPPORTUNITY TO ACQUIRE KNOWLEDGE FROM HIS LEADER.</P>

<P class="p8 ft16">THE MAJOR ATTRIBUTES OF LEADERSHIP</P>
<P class="p132 ft8">The following are important factors of leadership:-</P>
<P class="p33 ft10"><SPAN class="ft8">1.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft33">UNWAVERING COURAGE based upon knowledge of self, and of one’s occupa- tion. No follower wishes to be dominated by a leader who lacks </SPAN><NOBR>self-conﬁdence</NOBR> and courage. No intelligent follower will be dominated by such a leader very long.</P>
<P class="p130 ft10"><SPAN class="ft8">2.</SPAN><NOBR><SPAN class="ft34">SELF-CONTROL.</SPAN></NOBR> The man who cannot control himself, can never control oth- ers. <NOBR>Self-control</NOBR> sets a mighty example for one’s followers, which the more intel- ligent will emulate.</P>
<P class="p133 ft10"><SPAN class="ft8">3.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft34">A KEEN SENSE OF JUSTICE. Without a sense of fairness and justice, no lead- er can command and retain the respect of his followers.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p133 ft10"><SPAN class="ft8">4.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft35">DEFINITENESS OF DECISION. The man who wavers in his decisions, shows that he is not sure of himself. He cannot lead others successfully.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p12 ft10"><SPAN class="ft8">5.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft20">DEFINITENESS OF PLANS. The successful leader must plan his work, and work his plan. A leader who moves by guesswork, without practical, deﬁnite plans, is comparable to a ship without a rudder. Sooner or later he will land on the rocks.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p13 ft10"><SPAN class="ft8">6.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft34">THE HABIT OF DOING MORE THAN PAID FOR. One of the penalties of lead- ership is the necessity of willingness, upon the part of the leader, to do more than he requires of his followers.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p12 ft10"><SPAN class="ft8">7.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft35">A PLEASING PERSONALITY. No slovenly, careless person can become a suc- cessful leader. Leadership calls for respect. Followers will not respect a leader who does not grade high on all of the factors of a Pleasing Personality.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p13 ft10"><SPAN class="ft8">8.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft35">SYMPATHY AND UNDERSTANDING. The successful leader must be in sym- pathy with his followers. Moreover, he must understand them and their prob- lems.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p133 ft12"><SPAN class="ft8">9.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft26">MASTERY OF DETAIL. Successful leadership calls for mastery of details of the leader’s position.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p20 ft10"><SPAN class="ft36">10.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft34">WILLINGNESS TO ASSUME FULL RESPONSIBILITY. The successful leader must be willing to assume responsibility for the mistakes and the shortcomings of his followers. If he tries to shift this responsibility, he will not remain the lead- er. If one of his followers makes a mistake, and shows himself incompetent, the leader must consider that it is he who failed.</SPAN></P>

<P class="p15 ft10"><SPAN class="ft36">11.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft35">COOPERATION. The successful leader must understand, and apply the prin- ciple of cooperative effort and be able to induce his followers to do the same. Leadership calls for POWER, and power calls for COOPERATION. There are two forms of Leadership. The ﬁrst, and by far the most effective, is LEADERSHIP BY CONSENT of, and with the sympathy of the followers. The second is LEADER- SHIP BY FORCE, without the consent and sympathy of the followers.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p44 ft10">History is ﬁlled with evidences that Leadership by Force cannot endure. The downfall and disappearance of “Dictators” and kings is signiﬁcant. It means that people will not follow forced leadership indeﬁnitely.</P>
<P class="p36 ft10">The world has just entered a new era of relationship between leaders and follow- ers, which very clearly calls for new leaders, and a new brand of leadership in business and industry. Those who belong to the old school of <NOBR>leadership-by-force,</NOBR> must acquire an understanding of the new brand of leadership (cooperation) or be relegated to the rank and ﬁle of the followers. There is no other way out for them.</P>
<P class="p35 ft10">The relationship of employer and employee, or of leader and follower, in the fu- ture, will be one of mutual cooperation, based upon an equitable division of the proﬁts of business. In the future, the relationship of employer and employee will be more like a partnership than it has been in the past.</P>
<P class="p18 ft11">Napoleon, Kaiser Wilhelm of Germany, the Czar of Russia, and the King of Spain were examples of leadership by force. Their leadership passed. Without much dif- ﬁculty, one might point to the prototypes of these <NOBR>ex-leaders,</NOBR> among the business, ﬁnancial, and labor leaders of America who have been dethroned or slated to go. <NOBR>Leadership-by-consent</NOBR> of the followers is the only brand which can endure!</P>
<P class="p44 ft10">Men may follow the forced leadership temporarily, but they will not do so will- ingly.</P>
<P class="p18 ft11">The new brand of LEADERSHIP will embrace the eleven factors of leadership, described in this chapter, as well as some other factors. The man who makes these the basis of his leadership, will ﬁnd abundant opportunity to lead in any walk of life. The depression was prolonged, largely, because the world lacked LEADER- SHIP of the new brand. At the end of the depression, the demand for leaders who are competent to apply the new methods of leadership has greatly exceeded the supply. Some of the old type of leaders will reform and adapt themselves to the new brand of leadership, but generally speaking, the world will have to look for new timber for its leadership. This necessity may be your OPPORTUNITY!</P>

<DIV id="id_2">
<P class="p8 ft16">THE 10 MAJOR CAUSES OF FAILURE IN LEADERSHIP</P>
<P class="p134 ft10">We come now to the major faults of leaders who fail, because it is just as essential to know WHAT NOT TO DO as it is to know what to do.</P>
<P class="p60 ft11"><SPAN class="ft8">1.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft37">INABILITY TO ORGANIZE DETAILS. Efﬁcient leadership calls for ability to organize and to master details. No genuine leader is ever “too busy” to do anything which may be required of him in his capacity as leader. When a man, whether he is a leader or follower, admits that he is “too busy” to change his plans, or to give attention to any emergency, he admits his inefﬁciency. The successful leader must be the master of all details connected with his position. That means, of course, that he must acquire the habit of relegating details to capable lieutenants.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p129 ft10"><SPAN class="ft8">2.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft31">UNWILLINGNESS TO RENDER HUMBLE SERVICE. Truly great leaders are willing, when occasion demands, to perform any sort of labor which they would ask another to perform. “The greatest among ye shall be the servant of all” is a truth which all able leaders observe and respect.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p135 ft10"><SPAN class="ft8">3.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft38">EXPECTATION OF PAY FOR WHAT THEY “KNOW” INSTEAD OF WHAT THEY DO WITH THAT WHICH THEY KNOW. The world does not pay men for that which they “know.” It pays them for what they DO, or induce others to do.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p60 ft11"><SPAN class="ft8">4.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft39">FEAR OF COMPETITION FROM FOLLOWERS. The leader who fears that one of his followers may take his position is practically sure to realize that fear sooner or later. The able leader trains understudies to whom he may delegate, at will, any of the details of his position. Only in this way may a leader multiply himself and prepare himself to be at many places, and give attention to many things at one time. It is an eternal truth that men receive more pay for their ABILITY TO GET OTHERS TO PERFORM, than they could possibly earn by their own efforts. An efﬁcient leader may, through his knowledge of his job and the magnetism of his personality, greatly increase the efﬁciency of others, and induce them to render more service and better service than they could render without his aid.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p33 ft10"><SPAN class="ft8">5.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft40">LACK OF IMAGINATION. Without imagination, the leader is incapable of meeting emergencies, and of creating plans by which to guide his followers ef- ﬁciently.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p12 ft10"><SPAN class="ft8">6.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft34">SELFISHNESS. The leader who claims all the honor for the work of his follow- ers, is sure to be met by resentment. The really great leader CLAIMS NONE OF THE HONORS. He is contented to see the honors, when there are any, go to his followers, because he knows that most men will work harder for commendation and recognition than they will for money alone.</SPAN></P>

<P class="p15 ft10"><SPAN class="ft8">7.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft34">INTEMPERANCE. Followers do not respect an intemperate leader. Moreover, intemperance in any of its various forms, destroys the endurance and the vitality of all who indulge in it.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p18 ft10"><SPAN class="ft8">8.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft35">DISLOYALTY. Perhaps this should have come at the head of the list. The lead- er who is not loyal to his trust, and to his associates, those above him, and those below him, cannot long maintain his leadership. Disloyalty marks one as being less than the dust of the earth, and brings down on one’s head the contempt he deserves. Lack of loyalty is one of the major causes of failure in every walk of life.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p17 ft10"><SPAN class="ft8">9.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft20">EMPHASIS OF THE “AUTHORITY” OF LEADERSHIP. The efﬁcient leader leads by encouraging, and not by trying to instill fear in the hearts of his fol- lowers. The leader who tries to impress his followers with his “authority” comes within the category of leadership through FORCE. If a leader is a REAL LEADER, he will have no need to advertise that fact except by his </SPAN><NOBR>conduct-his</NOBR> sympathy, understanding, fairness, and a demonstration that he knows his job.</P>
<P class="p16 ft10"><SPAN class="ft36">10.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft31">EMPHASIS OF TITLE. The competent leader requires no “title” to give him the respect of his followers. The man who makes too much over his title generally has little else to emphasize. The doors to the ofﬁce of the real leader are open to all who wish to enter, and his working quarters are free from formality or ostenta- tion.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p17 ft10">These are among the more common of the causes of failure in leadership. Any one of these faults is sufﬁcient to induce failure. Study the list carefully if you aspire to leadership, and make sure that you are free of these faults.</P>
<P class="p136 ft15">SOME FERTILE FIELDS IN WHICH “NEW LEADERSHIP” WILL BE REQUIRED</P>
<P class="p18 ft10">Before leaving this chapter, your attention is called to a few of the fertile ﬁelds in which there has been a decline of leadership, and in which the new type of leader may ﬁnd an abundance of OPPORTUNITY.</P>
<P class="p137 ft10"><SPAN class="ft15">First</SPAN>. In the ﬁeld of politics there is a most insistent demand for new lead- ers; a demand which indicates nothing less than an emergency. The majority of politicians have, seemingly, become <NOBR>high-grade,</NOBR> legalized racketeers. They have increased taxes and debauched the machinery of industry and business until the people can no longer stand the burden.</P>

<P class="p138 ft10"><SPAN class="ft15">Second</SPAN>. The banking business is undergoing a reform. The leaders in this ﬁeld have almost entirely lost the conﬁdence of the public. Already the bankers have sensed the need of reform, and they have begun it.</P>
<P class="p77 ft10"><SPAN class="ft15">Third</SPAN>. Industry calls for new leaders. The old type of leaders thought and moved in terms of dividends instead of thinking and moving in terms of human equa- tions! The future leader in industry, to endure, must regard himself as a quasi- public ofﬁcial whose duty it is to manage his trust in such a way that it will work hardship on no individual, or group of individuals. Exploitation of working men is a thing of the past. Let the man who aspires to leadership in the ﬁeld of busi- ness, industry, and labor remember this.</P>
<P class="p139 ft10"><SPAN class="ft15">Fourth</SPAN>. The religious leader of the future will be forced to give more atten- tion to the temporal needs of his followers, in the solution of their economic and personal problems of the present, and less attention to the dead past, and the yet unborn future.</P>
<P class="p77 ft10"><SPAN class="ft15">Fifth</SPAN>. In the professions of law, medicine, and education, a new brand of leader- ship, and to some extent, new leaders will become a necessity. This is especially true in the ﬁeld of education. The leader in that ﬁeld must, in the future, ﬁnd ways and means of teaching people HOW TO APPLY the knowledge they receive in school. He must deal more with PRACTICE and less with THEORY.</P>
<P class="p140 ft10"><SPAN class="ft15">Sixth</SPAN>. New leaders will be required in the ﬁeld of Journalism. Newspapers of the future, to be conducted successfully, must be divorced from “special privi- lege” and relieved from the subsidy of advertising. They must cease to be organs of propaganda for the interests which patronize their advertising columns. The type of newspaper which publishes scandal and lewd pictures will eventually go the way of all forces which debauch the human mind.</P>
<P class="p141 ft10">These are but a few of the ﬁelds in which opportunities for new leaders and a new brand of leadership are now available. The world is undergoing a rapid change. This means that the media through which the changes in human habits are pro- moted, must be adapted to the changes. The media here described, are the ones which, more than any others, determine the trend of civilization.</P>
<P class="p75 ft16">WHEN AND HOW TO APPLY FOR A POSITION</P>
<P class="p142 ft10">The information described here is the net result of many years of experience during which thousands of men and women were helped to market their services effectively. It can, therefore, be relied upon as sound and practical.</P>

<P class="p8 ft16">MEDIA THROUGH WHICH SERVICES MAY BE MARKETED</P>
<P class="p143 ft10">Experience has proved that the following media offer the most direct and effec- tive methods of bringing the buyer and seller of personal services together.</P>
<P class="p12 ft10"><SPAN class="ft8">1.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft20">EMPLOYMENT BUREAUS. Care must be taken to select only reputable bu- reaus, the management of which can show adequate records of achievement of satisfactory results. There are comparatively few such bureaus.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p14 ft10"><SPAN class="ft8">2.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft20">ADVERTISING in newspapers, trade journals, magazines, and radio. Classiﬁed advertising may usually be relied upon to produce satisfactory results in the case of those who apply for clerical or ordinary salaried positions. Display advertising is more desirable in the case of those who seek executive connections, the copy to appear in the section of the paper which is most apt to come to the attention of the class of employer being sought. The copy should be prepared by an expert, who understands how to inject sufﬁcient selling qualities to produce replies.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p13 ft10"><SPAN class="ft8">3.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft41">PERSONAL LETTERS OF APPLICATION, directed to particular ﬁrms or in- dividuals most apt to need such services as are being offered. Letters should be neatly typed, ALWAYS, and signed by hand. With the letter, should be sent a complete “brief” or outline of the applicant’s qualiﬁcations. Both the letter of ap- plication and the brief of experience or qualiﬁcations should be prepared by an expert. (See instructions as to information to be supplied).</SPAN></P>
<P class="p20 ft10"><SPAN class="ft8">4.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft20">APPLICATION THROUGH PERSONAL ACQUAINTANCES. When possible, the applicant should endeavor to approach prospective employers through some mutual acquaintance. This method of approach is particularly advantageous in the case of those who seek executive connections and do not wish to appear to be “peddling” themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p13 ft10"><SPAN class="ft8">5.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft20">APPLICATION IN PERSON. In some </SPAN><NOBR>in-stances,</NOBR> it may be more effective if the applicant offers personally, his services to prospective employers, in which event a complete written statement of qualiﬁcations for the position should be presented, for the reason that prospective employers often wish to discuss with associates, one’s record.</P>
<P class="p46 ft16">INFORMATION TO BE SUPPLIED IN A WRITTEN “BRIEF”</P>
<P class="p129 ft10">This brief should be prepared as carefully as a lawyer would prepare the brief of a case to be tried m court. Unless the applicant is experienced in the preparation of such briefs, an expert should be consulted, and his services enlisted for this</P>

<P class="p19 ft10">purpose. Successful merchants employ men and women who understand the art and the psychology of advertising to present the merits of their merchandise. One who has personal services for sale should do the same. The following information should appear in the brief:</P>
<P class="p125 ft10"><SPAN class="ft36">1.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft20">Education. State brieﬂy, but deﬁnitely, what schooling you have had, and in what subjects you specialized in school, giving the reasons for that specializa- tion.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p12 ft10"><SPAN class="ft8">2.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft34">Experience. If you have had experience in connection with positions similar to the one you seek, describe it fully, state names and addresses of former employ- ers. Be sure to bring out clearly any special experience you may have had which would equip you to ﬁll the position you seek.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p144 ft10"><SPAN class="ft8">3.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft34">References. Practically every business ﬁrm desires to know all about the pre- vious records, antecedents, etc., of prospective employees who seek positions of responsibility. Attach to your brief photostatic copies of letters from:</SPAN></P>
<P class="p145 ft8"><SPAN class="ft8">a.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft42">Former employers</SPAN></P>
<P class="p146 ft8"><SPAN class="ft8">b.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft25">Teachers under whom you studied</SPAN></P>

<P class="p147 ft10"><SPAN class="ft8">4.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft20">Photograph of self. Attach to your brief a recent, unmounted photograph of yourself.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p130 ft10"><SPAN class="ft8">5.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft41">Apply for a speciﬁc position. Avoid application for a position without describ- ing EXACTLY what particular position you seek. Never apply for “just a position.” That indicates you lack specialized qualiﬁcations.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p144 ft10"><SPAN class="ft8">6.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft35">State your qualiﬁcations for the particular position for which you apply. Give full details as to the reason you believe you are qualiﬁed for the particular posi- tion you seek. This is THE APPLICATION. It will determine, more than anything else, what consideration you receive.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p148 ft11"><SPAN class="ft8">7.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft43">Offer to go to work on probation. In the majority of instances if you are de- termined to have the position for which you apply, it will be most effective if you offer to work for a week, or a month, or for a sufﬁcient length of time to enable your prospective employer to judge your value WITHOUT PAY. This may appear to be a radical suggestion, but experience has proved that it seldom fails to win at least a trial. If you are SURE OF YOUR QUALIFICATIONS, a trial is all you need.</SPAN></P>

<P class="p19 ft10">Incidentally, such an offer indicates that you have conﬁdence in your ability to ﬁll the position you seek. It is most convincing. If your offer is accepted, and you make good, more than likely you will be paid for your “probation” period. Make clear the fact that your offer is based upon:</P>
<P class="p149 ft8">a. Your conﬁdence in your ability to ﬁll the position.</P>
<P class="p150 ft12">b. Your conﬁdence in your prospective employer’s decision to employ you after trial.</P>
<P class="p151 ft8"><SPAN class="ft8">c.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft25">Your DETERMINATION to have the position you seek.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p20 ft10"><SPAN class="ft8">8.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft35">Knowledge of your prospective employer’s business. Before applying for a po- sition, do sufﬁcient research in connection with the business to familiarize your- self thoroughly with that business, and indicate in your brief the knowledge you have acquired in this ﬁeld.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p13 ft10">This will be impressive, as it will indicate that you have <NOBR>im-agination,</NOBR> and a real interest in the position you seek. Remember that it is not the lawyer who knows the most law, but the one who best prepares his case, who wins. If your “case” is properly prepared and presented, your victory will have been more than half won at the outset.</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">Do not be afraid of making your brief too long. Employers are just as much inter- ested in purchasing the services of <NOBR>well-qualiﬁed</NOBR> applicants as you are in securing employment. In fact, the success of most successful employers is due, in the main, to their ability to select <NOBR>well-qualiﬁed</NOBR> lieutenants. They want all the information available.</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">Remember another thing; neatness in the preparation of your brief will indicate that you are a painstaking person. I have helped to prepare briefs for clients which were so striking and out of the ordinary that they resulted in the employment of the applicant without a personal interview.</P>
<P class="p13 ft12">When your brief has been completed, have it neatly bound by an experienced binder, and lettered by an artist, or printer similar to the following:</P>

<P class="p158 ft8">Change names each time brief is shown.</P>
<P class="p22 ft11">This personal touch is sure to command attention. Have your brief neatly typed or mimeographed on the ﬁnest paper you can obtain, and bound with a heavy pa- per of the <NOBR>book-cover</NOBR> variety, the binder to be changed, and the proper ﬁrm name to be inserted if it is to be shown to more than one company. Your photograph should be pasted on one of the pages of your brief. Follow these instructions to the letter, improving upon them wherever your imagination suggests.</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">Successful salesmen groom themselves with care. They understand that ﬁrst im- pressions are lasting. Your brief is your salesman. Give it a good suit of clothes, so it will stand out in bold contrast to anything your prospective employer ever saw, in the way of an application for a position. If the position you seek is worth hav- ing, it is worth going after with care. Moreover, if you sell yourself to an employer in a manner that impresses him with your individuality, you probably will receive more money for your services from the very start, than you would if you applied for employment in the usual conventional way.</P>
<P class="p38 ft11">If you seek employment through an advertising agency, or an employment agency, have the agent use copies of your brief in marketing your services. This will help to gain preference for you, both with the agent, and the prospective employers.</P>
<P class="p75 ft16">HOW TO GET THE EXACT POSITION YOU DESIRE</P>
<P class="p33 ft10">Everyone enjoys doing the kind of work for which he is best suited. An artist loves to work with paints, a craftsman with his hands, a writer loves to write. Those with less deﬁnite talents have their preferences for certain ﬁelds of business and industry. If America does anything well, it offers a full range of occupations, till- ing the soil, manufacturing, marketing, and the professions.</P>

<P class="p160 ft8">b. The employee</P>
<P class="p146 ft8">c. The public they serve</P>
<P class="p33 ft10">This new way of marketing personal services is called new for many reasons, ﬁrst, both the employer and the employee of the future will be considered as fellow- employees whose business it will be to SERVE THE PUBLIC EFFICIENTLY. In times past, employers, and employees have bartered among themselves, driving the best bargains they could with one another, not considering that in the ﬁnal analysis they were, in reality, BARGAINING AT THE EXPENSE OF THE THIRD PARTY, THE PUBLIC THEY SERVED.</P>
<P class="p14 ft11">The depression served as a mighty protest from an injured public, whose rights had been trampled upon in every direction by those who were clamoring for indi- vidual advantages and proﬁts. When the debris of the depression shall have been cleared away, and business shall have been once again restored to balance, both employers and employees will recognize that they are NO LONGER PRIVILEGED TO DRIVE BARGAINS AT THE EXPENSE OF THOSE WHOM THEY SERVE. The real employer of the future will be the public. This should be kept uppermost in mind by every person seeking to market personal services effectively.</P>
<P class="p20 ft10">Nearly every railroad in America is in ﬁnancial difﬁculty. Who does not remem- ber the day when, if a citizen enquired at the ticket ofﬁce, the time of departure of a train, he was abruptly referred to the bulletin board instead of being politely given the information?</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">The street car companies have experienced a “change of times” also. There was a time not so very long ago when street car conductors took pride in giving argu- ment to passengers. Many of the street car tracks have been removed and passen- gers ride on a bus, whose driver is “the last word in politeness.”</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">All over the country street car tracks are rusting from abandonment, or have been taken up. <NOBR>Where-ever</NOBR> street cars are still in operation, passengers may now ride without argument, and one may even hail the car in the middle of the block, and the motorman will OBLIGINGLY pick him up.</P>
<P class="p12 ft10">HOW TIMES HAVE CHANGED! That is just the point I am trying to emphasize. TIMES HAVE CHANGED! Moreover, the change is reﬂected not merely in rail- road ofﬁces and on street cars, but in other walks of life as well. The <NOBR>“public-be-</NOBR></P>

<P class="p15 ft10">damned” policy is now passé. It has been supplanted by the <NOBR>“we-are-obligingly-</NOBR> <NOBR>at-your-service,</NOBR> sir,” policy.</P>
<P class="p18 ft10">The bankers have learned a thing or two during this rapid change which has taken place during the past few years. Impoliteness on the part of a bank ofﬁcial, or bank employee today is as rare as it was conspicuous a dozen years ago. In the years past, some bankers (not all of them, of course), carried an atmosphere of austerity which gave every <NOBR>would-be</NOBR> borrower a chill when he even thought of approaching his banker for a loan.</P>
<P class="p16 ft10">The thousands of bank failures during the depression had the effect of removing the mahogany doors behind which bankers formerly barricaded themselves. They now sit at desks in the open, where they may be seen and approached at will by any depositor, or by anyone who wishes to see them, and the whole atmosphere of the bank is one of courtesy and understanding.</P>
<P class="p17 ft10">It used to be customary for customers to have to stand and wait at the corner gro- cery until the clerks were through passing the time of day with friends, and the proprietor had ﬁnished making up his bank deposit, before being waited upon. Chain stores, managed by COURTEOUS MEN who do everything in the way of service, short of shining the customer’s shoes, have PUSHED THE <NOBR>OLD-TIME</NOBR> MERCHANTS INTO THE BACKGROUND. TIME MARCHES ON! “Courtesy” and “Service” are the <NOBR>watch-words</NOBR> of merchandising today, and apply to the per- son who is marketing personal services even more directly than to the employer whom he serves, because, in the ﬁnal analysis, both the employer and his em- ployee are EMPLOYED BY THE PUBLIC THEY SERVE. If they fail to serve well, they pay by the loss of their privilege of serving.</P>
<P class="p23 ft10">We can all remember the time when the <NOBR>gas-meter</NOBR> reader pounded on the door hard enough to break the panels. When the door was opened, he pushed his way in, uninvited, with a scowl on his face which plainly said, <NOBR>“what-the-hell-did-you-</NOBR> <NOBR>keep-me-waiting-for?”</NOBR> All that has undergone a change. The <NOBR>meter-man</NOBR> now conducts himself as a gentleman who is <NOBR>“delighted-to-be-at-your-service-sir.”</NOBR> Before the gas companies learned that their scowling <NOBR>meter-men</NOBR> were accumu- lating liabilities never to be cleared away, the polite salesmen of oil burners came along and did a land ofﬁce business.</P>
<P class="p16 ft10">During the depression, I spent several months in the anthracite coal region of Pennsylvania, studying conditions which all but destroyed the coal industry. Among several very signiﬁcant discoveries, was the fact that greed on the part of operators and their employees was the chief cause of the loss of business for the operators, and loss of jobs for the miners.</P>

<P class="p39 ft10">Through the pressure of a group of overzealous labor leaders, representing the employees, and the greed for proﬁts on the part of the operators, the anthracite business suddenly dwindled. The coal operators and their employees drove sharp bargains with one another, adding the cost of the “bargaining” to the price of the coal, until, ﬁnally, they discovered they had BUILT UP A WONDERFUL BUSI-</P>
<P class="p68 ft10">NESS FOR THE MANUFACTURERS OF OIL BURNING OUTFITS AND THE PRODUCERS OF CRUDE OIL.</P>
<P class="p12 ft10">“The wages of sin is death!” Many have read this in the Bible, but few have dis- covered its meaning. Now, and for several years, the entire world has been listen- ing BY FORCE, to a sermon which might well be called “WHATSOEVER A MAN SOWETH, THAT SHALL HE ALSO REAP.”</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">Nothing as widespread and effective as the depression could possibly be “just a coincidence.” Behind the depression was a CAUSE. Nothing ever happens with- out a CAUSE. In the main, the cause of the depression is traceable directly to the worldwide habit of trying to REAP without SOWING.</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">This should not be mistaken to mean that the depression represents a crop which the world is being FORCED to reap without having SOWN. The trouble is that the world sowed the wrong sort of seed. Any farmer knows he cannot sow the seed of thistles, and reap a harvest of grain. Beginning at the outbreak of the world war, the people of the world began to sow the seed of service inadequate in both qual- ity and quantity. Nearly everyone was engaged in the pastime of trying to GET WITHOUT GIVING.</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">These illustrations are brought to the attention of those who have personal serv- ices to market, to show that we are where we are, and what we are, because of our own conduct! If there is a principle of cause and effect, which controls business, ﬁnance, and transportation, this same principle controls individuals and deter- mines their economic status.</P>
<P class="p118 ft16">WHAT IS YOUR “QQS” RATING?</P>
<P class="p161 ft11">The causes of success in marketing services EFFECTIVELY and permanently, have been clearly described. Unless those causes are studied, analyzed, under- stood and APPLIED, no man can market his services effectively and permanently. Every person must be his own salesman of personal services. The QUALITY and the QUANTITY of service rendered, and the SPIRIT in which it is rendered, de- termine to a large extent, the price, and the duration of employment. To market</P>

<P class="p19 ft10">Personal services effectively, (which means a permanent market, at a satisfactory price, under pleasant conditions), one must adopt and follow the “QQS” formula which means that QUALITY, plus QUANTITY, plus the proper SPIRIT of coop- eration, equals perfect salesmanship of service. Remember the “QQS” formula, but do <NOBR>more-APPLY</NOBR> IT AS A HABIT!</P>
<P class="p46 ft8">Let us analyze the formula to make sure we understand exactly what it means.</P>
<P class="p33 ft10"><SPAN class="ft8">1.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft41">QUALITY of service shall be construed to mean the performance of every de- tail, in connection with your position, in the most efﬁcient manner possible, with the object of greater efﬁciency always in mind.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p12 ft10"><SPAN class="ft8">2.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft34">QUANTITY of service shall be understood to mean the HABIT of rendering all the service of which you are capable, at all times, with the purpose of increasing the amount of service </SPAN><NOBR>ren-dered</NOBR> as greater skill is developed through practice and experience. Emphasis is again placed on the word HABIT.</P>
<P class="p13 ft10"><SPAN class="ft8">3.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft34">SPIRIT of service shall be construed to mean the HABIT of agreeable, harmo- nious conduct which will induce cooperation from associates and fellow employ- ees.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p110 ft10">Adequacy of QUALITY and QUANTITY of service is not sufﬁcient to maintain a permanent market for your services. The conduct, or the SPIRIT in which you deliver service, is a strong determining factor in connection with both the price you receive, and the duration of employment.</P>
<P class="p14 ft10">Andrew Carnegie stressed this point more than others in connection with his de- scription of the factors which lead to success in the marketing of personal serv- ices. He emphasized again, and again, the necessity for HARMONIOUS CON- DUCT. He stressed the fact that he would not retain any man, no matter how great a QUANTITY, or how efﬁcient the QUALITY of his work, unless he worked in a spirit of HARMONY. Mr. Carnegie insisted upon men being AGREEABLE.</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">To prove that he placed a high value upon this quality, he permitted many men who conformed to his standards to become very wealthy. Those who did not con- form, had to make room for others.</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">The importance of a pleasing personality has been stressed, because it is a factor which enables one to render service in the proper SPIRIT. If one has a personal- ity which PLEASES, and renders service in a spirit of HARMONY, these assets often make up for deﬁciencies in both the QUALITY, and the QUANTITY of serv- ice one renders. Nothing, however, can be SUCCESSFULLY SUBSTITUTED FOR PLEASING CONDUCT.</P>

<P class="p8 ft16">THE CAPITAL VALUE OF YOUR SERVICES</P>
<P class="p119 ft10">The person whose income is derived entirely from the sale of personal services is no less a merchant than the man who sells commodities, and it might well be added, such a person is subject to EXACTLY THE SAME RULES of conduct as the merchant who sells merchandise.</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">This has been emphasized, because the majority of people who live by the sale of personal services make the mistake of considering themselves free from the rules of conduct, and the responsibilities attached to those who are engaged in market- ing commodities.</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">The new way of marketing services has practically forced both employer and. em- ployee into partnership alliances, through which both take into consideration the rights of the third party, THE PUBLIC THEY SERVE.</P>
<P class="p12 ft10">The day of the <NOBR>“go-getter”</NOBR> has passed. He has been supplanted by the <NOBR>“go-giver.”</NOBR> <NOBR>High-pressure</NOBR> methods in business ﬁnally blew the lid off. There will never be the need to put the lid back on, because, in the future, business will be conducted by methods that will require no pressure.</P>
<P class="p14 ft10">The actual capital value of your brains may be determined by the amount of in- come you can produce (by marketing your services). A fair estimate of the capital value of your services may be made by multiplying your annual income by sixteen and <NOBR>two-thirds,</NOBR> as it is reasonable to estimate that your annual income represents six percent of your capital value. Money rents for 6% per annum.</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">Money is worth no more than brains. It is often worth much less. Competent “brains,” if effectively marketed, represent a much more desirable form of capi- tal than that which is required to conduct a business dealing in commodities, because “brains” are a form of capital which cannot be permanently depreciated through depressions, nor can this form of capital be stolen or spent.</P>
<P class="p13 ft12">Moreover, the money which is essential for the conduct of business is as worth- less as a sand dune, until it has been mixed with efﬁcient “brains.”</P>

<P class="p34 ft10">tragedy lies in the overwhelmingly large majority of people who fail, as compared to the few who succeed. I have had the privilege of analyzing several thousand men and women, 98% of whom were classed as “failures.” There is something radically wrong with a civilization, and a system of education, which permit 98% of the people to go through life as failures. But I did not write this book for the purpose of moralizing on the rights and wrongs of the world; that would require a book a hundred times the size of this one.</P>
<P class="p35 ft10">My analysis work proved that there are thirty major reasons for failure, and thir- teen major principles through which people accumulate fortunes. In this chapter, a description of the thirty major causes of failure will be given. As you go over the list, check yourself by it, point by point, for the purpose of discovering how many of these <NOBR>causes-of-failure</NOBR> stand between you and success.</P>
<P class="p17 ft11"><SPAN class="ft8">1.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft45">UNFAVORABLE HEREDITARY BACKGROUND. There is but little, if anything, which can be done for people who are born with a deﬁciency in brain power. This philosophy offers but one method of bridging this </SPAN><NOBR>weakness-through</NOBR> the aid of the Master Mind. Observe with proﬁt, however, that this is the ONLY one of the thirty causes of failure which may not be easily corrected by any individual.</P>
<P class="p44 ft10"><SPAN class="ft8">2.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft34">LACK OF A </SPAN><NOBR>WELL-DEFINED</NOBR> PURPOSE IN LIFE. There is no hope of success for the person who does not have a central purpose, or deﬁnite goal at which to aim. <NOBR>Ninety-eight</NOBR> out of every hundred of those whom I have analyzed, had no such aim. Perhaps this was the</P>
<P class="p44 ft10"><SPAN class="ft8">3.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft41">LACK OF AMBITION TO AIM ABOVE MEDIOCRITY. We offer no hope for the person who is so indifferent as not to want to get ahead in life, and who is not willing to pay the price.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p18 ft11"><SPAN class="ft8">4.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft45">INSUFFICIENT EDUCATION. This is a handicap which may be overcome with comparative ease. Experience has proven that the </SPAN><NOBR>best-educated</NOBR> people are often those who are known as <NOBR>“self-made,”</NOBR> or <NOBR>self-educated.</NOBR> It takes more than a col- lege degree to make one a person of education. Any person who is educated is one who has learned to get whatever he wants in life without violating the rights of others. Education consists, not so much of knowledge, but of knowledge effec- tively and persistently APPLIED. Men are paid, not merely for what they know, but more particularly for WHAT THEY DO WITH THAT WHICH THEY KNOW.</P>
<P class="p16 ft11">5.LACK OF <NOBR>SELF-DISCIPLINE.</NOBR> Discipline comes through <NOBR>self-control.</NOBR> This means that one must control all negative qualities. Before you can control condi- tions, you must ﬁrst control yourself. <NOBR>Self-mastery</NOBR> is the hardest job you will ever tackle. If you do not conquer self, you will be conquered by self.

<P class="p12 ft10"><SPAN class="ft8">6.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft34">ILL HEALTH. No person may enjoy outstanding success without good health. Many of the causes of ill health are subject to mastery and control. These, in the main are:</SPAN></P>
<P class="p162 ft8"><SPAN class="ft8">a.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft25">Overeating of foods not conducive to health</SPAN></P>
<P class="p163 ft8"><SPAN class="ft8">b.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft25">Wrong habits of thought; giving expression to negatives.</SPAN></P>

<P class="p33 ft10"><SPAN class="ft8">7.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft34">UNFAVORABLE ENVIRONMENTAL INFLUENCES DURING CHILDHOOD. “As the twig is bent, so shall the tree grow.” Most people who have criminal ten- dencies acquire them as the result of bad environment, and improper associates during childhood.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p13 ft10"><SPAN class="ft8">8.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft41">PROCRASTINATION. This is one of the most common causes of failure. “Old Man Procrastination” stands within the shadow of every human being, waiting his opportunity to spoil one’s chances of success. Most of us go through life as failures, because we are waiting for the “time to be right” to start doing some- thing worthwhile. Do not wait. The time will never be “just right.” Start where you stand, and work with whatever tools you may have at your command, and better tools will be found as you go along.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p14 ft11"><SPAN class="ft8">9.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft46">LACK OF PERSISTENCE. Most of us are good “starters” but poor “ﬁnishers” of everything we begin. Moreover, people are prone to give up at the ﬁrst signs of de- feat. There is no substitute for PERSISTENCE. The person who makes PERSIST- ENCE his </SPAN><NOBR>watch-word,</NOBR> discovers that “Old Man Failure” ﬁnally becomes tired, and makes his departure. Failure cannot cope with PERSISTENCE.</P>
<P class="p13 ft10"><SPAN class="ft36">10.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft20">NEGATIVE PERSONALITY. There is no hope of success for the person who repels people through a negative personality. Success comes through the applica- tion of POWER, and power is attained through the cooperative efforts of other people. A negative personality will not induce cooperation.</SPAN></P>

Moreover, it will be a form of failure that is marked by misery and unhappiness, destroying all signs of AMBITION.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p17 ft10"><SPAN class="ft8">16.</SPAN><NOBR><SPAN class="ft20">OVER-CAUTION.</SPAN></NOBR> The person who takes no chances, generally has to take whatever is left when others are through choosing. <NOBR>Over-caution</NOBR> is as bad as un- <NOBR>der-caution.</NOBR> Both are extremes to be guarded against. Life itself is ﬁlled with the element of chance.</P>
<P class="p18 ft10"><SPAN class="ft8">17.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft32">WRONG SELECTION OF ASSOCIATES IN BUSINESS. This is one of the most common causes of failure in business. In marketing personal services, one should use great care to select an employer who will be an inspiration, and who is, himself, intelligent and successful. We emulate those with whom we associate most closely. Pick an employer who is worth </SPAN><NOBR>emu-lating.</NOBR></P>
<P class="p17 ft10"><SPAN class="ft8">18.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft41">SUPERSTITION AND PREJUDICE. Superstition is a form of fear. It is also a sign of ignorance. Men who succeed keep open minds and are afraid of nothing.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p18 ft10"><SPAN class="ft8">19.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft48">WRONG SELECTION OF A VOCATION. No man can succeed in a line of endeavor which he does not like. The most essential step in the marketing of per- sonal services is that of selecting an occupation into which you can throw yourself wholeheartedly.</SPAN></P>

<P class="p165 ft12"><SPAN class="ft8">20.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft49">LACK OF CONCENTRATION OF EFFORT. The </SPAN><NOBR>“jack-of-all-trades”</NOBR> seldom is good at any. Concentrate all of your efforts on one DEFINITE CHIEF AIM.</P>
<P class="p35 ft10"><SPAN class="ft8">21.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft40">THE HABIT OF INDISCRIMINATE SPENDING. The </SPAN><NOBR>spend-thrift</NOBR> cannot succeed, mainly because he stands eternally in FEAR OF POVERTY. Form the habit of systematic saving by putting aside a deﬁnite percentage of your income. Money in the bank gives one a very safe foundation of COURAGE when bargain- ing for the sale of personal services. Without money, one must take what one is offered, and be glad to get it.</P>
<P class="p44 ft10"><SPAN class="ft8">22.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft40">LACK OF ENTHUSIASM. Without enthusiasm one cannot be convincing. Moreover, enthusiasm is contagious, and the person who has it, under control, is generally welcome in any group of people.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p36 ft10"><SPAN class="ft8">23.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft35">INTOLERANCE. The person with a “closed” mind on any subject seldom gets ahead. Intolerance means that one has stopped acquiring knowledge. The most damaging forms of intolerance are those connected with religious, racial, and po- litical differences of opinion.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p44 ft10"><SPAN class="ft8">24.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft34">INTEMPERANCE. The most damaging forms of intemperance are connected with eating, strong drink, and sexual activities. Overindulgence in any of these is fatal to success.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p36 ft10"><SPAN class="ft8">25.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft20">INABILITY TO COOPERATE WITH OTHERS. More people lose their posi- tions and their big opportunities in life, because of this fault, than for all other reasons combined. It is a fault which no </SPAN><NOBR>well-informed</NOBR> business man, or leader will tolerate.</P>
<P class="p17 ft10"><SPAN class="ft8">26.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft41">POSSESSION OF POWER THAT WAS NOT ACQUIRED THROUGH SELF EFFORT. (Sons and daughters of wealthy men, and others who inherit money which they did not earn). Power in the hands of one who did not acquire it gradu- ally, is often fatal to success. QUICK RICHES are more dangerous than poverty.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p44 ft10"><SPAN class="ft8">27.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft41">INTENTIONAL DISHONESTY. There is no substitute for honesty. One may be temporarily dishonest by force of circumstances over which one has no con- trol, without permanent damage. But, there is NO HOPE for the person who is dishonest by choice. Sooner or later, his deeds will catch up with him, and he will pay by loss of reputation, and perhaps even loss of liberty.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p166 ft12"><SPAN class="ft8">28.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft50">EGOTISM AND VANITY. These qualities serve as red lights which warn oth- ers to keep away. THEY ARE FATAL TO SUCCESS.</SPAN></P>

<P class="p19 ft10"><SPAN class="ft8">29.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft34">GUESSING INSTEAD OF THINKING. Most people are too indifferent or lazy to acquire FACTS with which to THINK ACCURATELY. They prefer to act on “opinions” created by guesswork or </SPAN><NOBR>snap-judgments.</NOBR></P>
<P class="p60 ft10"><SPAN class="ft8">30.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft34">LACK OF CAPITAL. This is a common cause of failure among those who start out in business for the ﬁrst time, without sufﬁcient reserve of capital to absorb the shock of their mistakes, and to carry them over until they have established a</SPAN></P>
<P class="p62 ft8">REPUTATION.</P>
<P class="p167 ft12"><SPAN class="ft36">31.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft51">Under this, name any particular cause of failure from which you have suffered that has not been included in the foregoing list.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p141 ft10">In these thirty major causes of failure is found a description of the tragedy of life, which obtains for practically every person who tries and fails. It will be helpful if you can induce someone who knows you well to go over this list with you, and help to analyze you by the thirty causes of failure. It may be beneﬁcial if you try this alone. Most people cannot see themselves as others see them. You may be one who cannot.</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">The oldest of admonitions is “Man, know thyself!” If you market merchandise successfully, you must know the merchandise. The same is true in marketing per- sonal services. You should know all of your weaknesses in order that you may either bridge them or eliminate them entirely. You should know your strength in order that you may call attention to it when selling your services. You can know yourself only through accurate analysis.</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">The folly of ignorance in connection with self was displayed by a young man who applied to the manager of a well known business for a position. He made a very good impression until the manager asked him what salary he expected. He re- plied that he had no ﬁxed</P>
<P class="p13 ft12">sum in mind (lack of a deﬁnite aim). The manager then said, “We will pay you all you are worth, alter we try you out for a week.”</P>
<P class="p20 ft12">“I will not accept it,” the applicant replied, “because I AM GETTING MORE THAN THAT WHERE I AM NOW EMPLOYED.”</P>
<P class="p20 ft10">Before you even start to negotiate for a readjustment of your salary in your present position, or to seek employment elsewhere, BE SURE THAT YOU ARE WORTH MORE THAN YOU NOW RECEIVE.</P>

<P class="p39 ft10">It is one thing to WANT <NOBR>money-everyone</NOBR> wants <NOBR>more-but</NOBR> it is something entire- ly different to be WORTH MORE!

<P class="p33 ft10">Annual <NOBR>self-analysis</NOBR> is an essential in the effective marketing of personal services, as is annual inventory in merchandising. Moreover, the yearly analysis should disclose a DECREASE IN FAULTS, and an increase in VIRTUES. One goes ahead, stands still, or goes backward in life. One’s object should be, of course, to go ahead. Annual <NOBR>self-analysis</NOBR> will disclose whether advancement has been, made, and if so, how much. It will also disclose any backward steps one may have made. The effective marketing of personal services requires one to move forward even if the progress is slow.</P>
<P class="p20 ft10">Your annual <NOBR>self-analysis</NOBR> should be made at the end of each year, so you can include in your New Year’s Resolutions any improvements which the analysis indicates should be made.

If you doubt this statement, test its soundness by answering in writing the twenty- eight <NOBR>self-analysis</NOBR> questions. That might be both interesting and proﬁtable, even though you do not doubt the sound <NOBR>-ness</NOBR> of the statement.</P>
<P class="p171 ft15">WHERE AND HOW ONE MAY FIND OPPORTUNITIES TO ACCUMU- LATE RICHES</P>
<P class="p105 ft10">Now that we have analyzed the principles by which riches may be accumulat- ed, we naturally ask, “where may one ﬁnd favorable opportunities to apply these principles?” Very well, let us take inventory and see what the United States of America offer the person seeking riches, great or small.</P>
<P class="p17 ft10">To begin with, let us remember, all of us, that we live in a country where every <NOBR>law-abiding</NOBR> citizen enjoys freedom of thought and freedom of deed unequaled anywhere in the world. Most of us have never taken inventory of the advantages of this freedom. We have never compared our unlimited freedom with the cur- tailed freedom in other countries.</P>
<P class="p17 ft10">Here we have freedom of thought, freedom in the choice and enjoyment of educa- tion, freedom in religion, freedom in politics, freedom in the choice of a business, profession or occupation, freedom to accumulate and own without molestation, ALL THE PROPERTY WE CAN ACCUMULATE, freedom to choose our place of residence, freedom in marriage, freedom through equal opportunity to all races, freedom of travel from one state to another, freedom in our choice of foods, and freedom to AIM FOR ANY STATION IN LIFE FOR WHICH WE HAVE PRE- PARED OURSELVES, even for the presidency of the United States.</P>
<P class="p16 ft10">We have other forms of freedom, but this list will give a bird’s eye view of the most important, which constitute OPPORTUNITY of the highest order. This ad- vantage of freedom is all the more conspicuous because the United States is the only country guaranteeing to every citizen, whether native born or naturalized, so broad and varied a list of freedom.</P>
<P class="p17 ft10">Next, let us recount some of the blessings which our widespread freedom has placed within our hands. Take the average American family for example (mean- ing, the family of average income) and sum up the beneﬁts available to every member of the family, in this land of OPPORTUNITY and plenty!</P>
<P class="p172 ft12">a. FOOD. Next to freedom of thought and deed comes FOOD, CLOTHING, and SHELTER, the three basic necessities of life. Because of our universal freedom</P>

Observe that this simple breakfast was gathered, by some strange form of magic (?) from China, South America, Utah, Kansas and the New England States, and delivered on the breakfast table, ready for consumption, in the very heart of the most crowded city in America, at a cost well within the means of the most humble laborer.</P>

<P class="p19 ft10">wall. The husband shaves with an electric shaver, and they receive entertainment from all over the world, twenty four hours a day, if they want it, without cost, by merely turning the dial of their radio. There are other conveniences in this apart- ment, but the foregoing list will give a fair idea of some of the concrete evidences of the freedom we, of America, enjoy. (And this is neither political nor economic propaganda).</P>
<P class="p20 ft10">c. CLOTHING. Anywhere in the United States, the woman of average clothing requirements can dress very comfortably and neatly for less than $200.00 a year, and the average man can dress for the same, or less.</P>
<P class="p110 ft10">Only the three basic necessities of food, clothing, and shelter have been men- tioned. The average American citizen has other privileges and advantages availa- ble in return for modest effort, not exceeding eight hours per day of labor. Among these is the privilege of automobile transportation, with which one can go and come at will, at very small cost.</P>
<P class="p14 ft11">The average American has security of property rights not found in any other coun- try in the world. He can place his surplus money in a bank with the assurance that his government will protect it, and make good to him if the bank fails. If an American citizen wants to travel from one state to another he needs no passport, no one’s permission. He may go when he pleases, and return at will. Moreover, he may travel by train, private automobile, bus, airplane, or ship, as his pocketbook permits. In Germany, Russia, Italy, and most of the other European and Oriental countries, the people cannot travel with so much freedom, and at so little cost.</P>
<P class="p118 ft16">THE “MIRACLE” THAT HAS PROVIDED THESE BLESSINGS</P>
<P class="p97 ft10">We often hear politicians proclaiming the freedom of America, when they solicit votes, but seldom do they take the time or devote sufﬁcient effort to the analy- sis of the source or nature of this “freedom.” Having no axe to grind, no grudge to express, no ulterior motives to be carried out, I have the privilege of going into a frank analysis of that mysterious, abstract, greatly misunderstood “SOME- THING” which gives to every citizen of America more blessings, more opportuni- ties to accumulate wealth, more freedom of every nature, than may be found in any other country.</P>
<P class="p20 ft10">I have the right to analyze the source and nature of this UNSEEN POWER, be- cause I know, and have known for more than a quarter of a century, many of the men who organized that power, and many who are now responsible for its main- tenance. The name of this mysterious benefactor of mankind is CAPITAL!</P>

<P class="p15 ft10">CAPITAL consists not alone of money, but more particularly of highly organized, intelligent groups of men who plan ways and means of using money efﬁciently for the good of the public, and proﬁtably to themselves. These groups consist of sci- entists, educators, chemists, inventors, business analysts, publicity men, trans- portation experts, accountants, lawyers, doctors, and both men and women who have highly specialized knowledge in all ﬁelds of industry and business.</P>
<P class="p44 ft10">They pioneer, experiment, and blaze trails in new ﬁelds of endeavor. They sup- port colleges, hospitals, public schools, build good roads, publish newspapers, pay most of the cost of government, and take care of the multitudinous detail es- sential to human progress.</P>
<P class="p44 ft10">Stated brieﬂy, the capitalists are the brains of civilization, because they supply the entire fabric of which all education, enlightenment and human progress con- sists.</P>
<P class="p36 ft10">Money, without brains, always is dangerous. Properly used, it is the most impor- tant essential of civilization. The simple breakfast here described could not have been delivered to the New York family at a dime each, or at any other price, if or- ganized capital had not provided the machinery, the ships, the railroads, and the huge armies of trained men to operate them.</P>
<P class="p44 ft10">Some slight idea of the importance of ORGANIZED CAPITAL may be had by try- ing to imagine yourself burdened with the responsibility of collecting, without the aid of capital, and delivering to the New York City family, the simple breakfast described.</P>
<P class="p44 ft10">To supply the tea, you would have to make a trip to China or India, both a very long way from America. Unless you are an excellent swimmer, you would become rather tired before making the round trip. Then, too, another problem would con- front you.</P>
<P class="p36 ft10">What would you use for money, even if you had the physical endurance to swim the ocean?</P>
<P class="p36 ft10">To supply the sugar, you would have to take another long swim to Cuba, or a long walk to the sugar beet section of Utah. But even then, you might come back without the sugar, because organized effort and money are necessary to produce sugar, to say nothing of what is required to reﬁne, transport, and deliver it to the breakfast table anywhere in the United States.</P>

<P class="p34 ft10">The eggs, you could deliver easily enough from the barn yards near New York City, but you would have a very long walk to Florida and return, before you could serve the two glasses of grapefruit juice. You would have another long walk, to Kansas, or one of the other wheat growing states, when you went after the four slices of wheat bread.</P>
<P class="p44 ft10">The Rippled Wheat Biscuits would have to be omitted from the menu, because they would not be available except through the labor of a trained organization of men and suitable machinery, ALL OF WHICH CALL FOR CAPITAL.</P>
<P class="p44 ft10">While resting, you could take off for another little swim down to South America, where you would pick up a couple of bananas, and on your return, you could take a short walk to the nearest farm having a dairy and pick up some butter and cream. Then your New York City family would be ready to sit down and enjoy breakfast, and you could collect your two dimes for your labor!</P>
<P class="p44 ft10">Seems absurd, doesn’t it? Well, the procedure described would be the only pos- sible way these simple items of food could be delivered to the heart of New York City, if we had no capitalistic system.</P>
<P class="p36 ft10">The sum of money required for the building and maintenance of the railroads and steam ships used in the delivery of that simple breakfast is so huge that it staggers one’s imagination. It runs into hundreds of millions of dollars, not to mention the armies of trained employees required to man the ships and trains. But, trans- portation is only a part of the requirements of modern civilization in capitalistic America. Before there can be anything to haul, something must be grown from the ground, or manufactured and prepared for market. This calls for more mil- lions of dollars for equipment, machinery, boxing, marketing, and for the wages of millions of men and women.</P>
<P class="p35 ft10">Steam ships and railroads do not spring up from the earth and function auto- matically. They come in response to the call of civilization, through the labor and ingenuity and organizing ability of men who have IMAGINATION, FAITH, EN- THUSIASM, DECISION, PERSISTENCE! These men are known as capitalists. They are motivated by the desire to build, construct, achieve, render useful serv- ice, earn proﬁts and accumulate riches. And, because they RENDER SERVICE WITHOUT WHICH THERE WOULD BE NO CIVILIZATION, they put them- selves in the way of great riches.</P>
<P class="p16 ft10">Just to keep the record simple and understandable, I will add that these capi- talists are the <NOBR>self-same</NOBR> men of whom most of us have heard <NOBR>soap-box</NOBR> orators speak. They are the same men to whom radicals, racketeers, dishonest politicians and grafting labor leaders refer as “the predatory interests,” or “Wall Street.”</P>

<P class="p15 ft10">I am not attempting to present a brief for or against any group of men or any sys- tem of economics. I am not attempting to condemn collective bargaining when I refer to “grafting labor leaders,” nor do I aim to give a clean bill of health to all individuals known as capitalists.</P>
<P class="p18 ft10">The purpose of this <NOBR>book-A</NOBR> purpose to which I have faithfully devoted over a quarter of a <NOBR>century-is</NOBR> to present to all who want the knowledge, the most de- pendable philosophy through which individuals may accumulate riches in what- ever amounts they desire.</P>
<P class="p17 ft12">I have here analyzed the economic advantages of the capitalistic system for the <NOBR>two-fold</NOBR> purpose of showing:</P>
<P class="p21 ft12"><SPAN class="ft8">1.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft54">that all who seek riches must recognize and adapt themselves to the system that controls all approaches to fortunes, large or small, and</SPAN></P>
<P class="p16 ft10"><SPAN class="ft8">2.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft55">to present the side of the picture opposite to that being shown by politicians and demagogues who deliberately becloud the issues they bring up, by referring to organized capital as if it were something poisonous.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p185 ft10">This is a capitalistic country, it was developed through the use of capital, and we who claim the right to partake of the blessings of freedom and opportunity, we who seek to accumulate riches here, may as well know that neither riches nor opportunity would be available to us if ORGANIZED CAPITAL had not provided these beneﬁts.</P>
<P class="p17 ft10">For more than twenty years it has been a somewhat popular and growing pastime for radicals, <NOBR>self-seeking</NOBR> politicians, racketeers, crooked labor leaders, and on occasion religious leaders, to take <NOBR>pot-shots</NOBR> at “WALL STREET, THE MONEY CHANGERS, and BIG BUSINESS.”</P>
<P class="p17 ft10">The practice became so general that we witnessed during the business depres- sion, the unbelievable sight of high government ofﬁcials lining up with the cheap politicians, and labor leaders, with the openly avowed purpose of throttling the system which has made Industrial America the richest country on earth. The line- up was so general and so well organized that it prolonged the worst depression America has ever known. It cost millions of men their jobs, because those jobs were inseparably a part of the industrial and capitalistic system which form the very backbone of the nation.</P>

<P class="p15 ft10">During this unusual alliance of government ofﬁcials and <NOBR>self-seeking</NOBR> individu- als who were endeavoring to proﬁt by declaring “open season” on the American system of industry, a certain type of labor leader joined forces with the politicians and offered to deliver voters in return for legislation designed to permit men to</P>
<P class="p186 ft10">TAKE RICHES AWAY FROM INDUSTRY BY ORGANIZED FORCE OF NUM- BERS, INSTEAD OF THE BETTER METHOD OF GIVING A FAIR DAY’S WORK FOR A FAIR DAY’S PAY.</P>
<P class="p36 ft10">Millions of men and women throughout the nation are still engaged in this popu- lar pastime of trying to GET without GIVING. Some of them are lined up with labor unions, where they demand SHORTER HOURS AND MORE PAY! Others do not take the trouble to work at all. THEY DEMAND GOVERNMENT RELIEF AND ARE GETTING IT. Their idea of their rights of freedom was demonstrated in New York City, where violent complaint was registered with the Postmaster, by a group of “relief beneﬁciaries,” because the Postmen awakened them at 7:30 A.M. to deliver Government relief checks. They DEMANDED that the time of de- livery be set up to 10:00 o’clock.</P>
<P class="p35 ft10">If you are one of those who believe that riches can be accumulated by the mere act of men who organize themselves into groups and demand MORE PAY for LESS SERVICE, if you are one of those who DEMAND Government relief without early morning disturbance when the money is delivered to you, if you are one of those who believe in trading their votes to politicians in return for the passing of laws which permit the raiding of the public treasury, you may rest securely on your belief, with certain knowledge that no one will disturb you, because THIS IS A FREE COUNTRY WHERE EVERY MAN MAY THINK AS HE PLEASES, where nearly everybody can live with but little effort, where many may live well without doing any work whatsoever.</P>
<P class="p43 ft10">However, you should know the full truth concerning this FREEDOM of which so many people boast, and so few understand. As great as it is, as far as it reaches, as many privileges as it provides, IT DOES NOT, AND CANNOT BRING RICHES WITHOUT EFFORT.</P>
<P class="p44 ft10">There is but one dependable method of accumulating, and legally holding riches, and that is by rendering useful service. No system has ever been created by which men can legally acquire riches through mere force of numbers, or without giving in return an equivalent value of one form or another.</P>
<P class="p18 ft11">There is a principle known as the law of ECONOMICS! This is more than a theory. It is a law no man can beat. Mark well the name of the principle, and remember it, because it is far more powerful than all the politicians and political machines.</P>

<P class="p34 ft10">It is above and beyond the control of all the labor unions. It cannot be swayed, nor inﬂuenced nor bribed by racketeers or <NOBR>self-appointed</NOBR> leaders in any calling. Moreover, IT HAS AN <NOBR>ALL-SEEING</NOBR> EYE, AND A PERFECT SYSTEM OF BOOK- KEEPING, in which it keeps an accurate account of the transactions of every hu- man being engaged in the business of trying to get without giving. Sooner or later its auditors come around, look over the records of individuals both great and small, and demand an accounting.</P>
<P class="p16 ft11">“Wall Street, Big Business, Capital Predatory Interests,” or whatever name you choose to give the system which has given us AMERICAN FREEDOM, represents a group of men who understand, respect, and adapt themselves to this powerful LAW OF ECONOMICS! Their ﬁnancial continuation depends upon their respect- ing the law. Most people living in America like this country, its capitalistic system and all. I must confess I know of no better country, where one may ﬁnd greater opportunities to accumulate riches. Judging by their acts and deeds, there are some in this country who do not like it. That, of course is their privilege; if they do not like this country, its capitalistic system, its boundless opportunities, THEY HAVE THE PRIVILEGE OF CLEARING OUT! Always there are other countries, such as Germany, Russia, and Italy, where one may try one’s hand at enjoying freedom, and accumulating riches providing one is not too particular.</P>
<P class="p43 ft10">America provides all the freedom and all the opportunity to accumulate riches that any honest person may require. When one goes hunting for game, one selects hunting grounds where game is plentiful. When seeking riches, the same rule would naturally obtain.</P>
<P class="p44 ft10">If it is riches you are seeking, do not overlook the possibilities of a country whose citizens are so rich that women, alone, spend over two hundred million dollars annually for <NOBR>lip-sticks,</NOBR> rouge and cosmetics. Think twice, you who are seeking riches, before trying to destroy the Capitalistic System of a country whose citizens spend over ﬁfty million dollars a year for GREETING CARDS, with which to ex- press their appreciation of their FREEDOM!</P>
<P class="p44 ft10">If it is money you are seeking, consider carefully a country that spends hundreds of millions of dollars annually for cigarettes, the bulk of the income from which goes to only four major companies engaged in supplying this national builder of <NOBR>“non-chalance”</NOBR> and “quiet nerves.” By all means give plenty of consideration to a country whose people spend annually more than ﬁfteen million dollars for the privilege of seeing moving pictures, and toss in a few additional millions for liq- uor, narcotics, and other less potent soft drinks and <NOBR>giggle-waters.</NOBR></P>

<P class="p19 ft10">Do not be in too big a hurry to get away from a country whose people willingly, even eagerly, hand over millions of dollars annually for football, baseball, and prize ﬁghts. And, by all means, STICK by a country whose inhabitants give up more than a million dollars a year for chewing gum, and another million for safe- ty razor blades.</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">Remember, also, that this is but the beginning of the available sources for the accumulation of wealth. Only a few of the luxuries and <NOBR>non-essentials</NOBR> have been mentioned. But, remember that the business of producing, transporting, and marketing these few items of merchandise gives regular employment to MANY MILLIONS OF MEN AND WOMEN, who receive for their services MANY MIL- LIONS OF DOLLARS MONTHLY, and spend it freely for both the luxuries and the necessities.</P>
<P class="p20 ft10">Especially remember, that back of all this exchange of merchandise and personal services may be found an abundance of OPPORTUNITY to accumulate riches. Here our AMERICAN <NOBR>FREE-DOM</NOBR> comes to one’s aid. There is nothing to stop you, or anyone from engaging in any portion of the effort necessary to carry on these businesses. If one has superior talent, training, experience, one may accu- mulate riches in large amounts. Those not so fortunate may accumulate smaller amounts.

<P class="p33 ft10">The LAW OF ECONOMICS was passed by Nature! There is no Supreme Court to which violators of this law may appeal. The law hands out both penalties for its violation, and appropriate rewards for its observance, without interference or the possibility of interference by any human being. The law cannot be repealed. It is as ﬁxed as the stars in the heavens, and subject to, and a part of the same system that controls the stars.</P>

<P class="p8 ft8">May one refuse to adapt one’s self to the LAW OF ECONOMICS?</P>
<P class="p20 ft10">Certainly! This is a free country, where all men are born with equal rights, includ- ing the privilege of ignoring the LAW OF ECONOMICS.</P>
<P class="p40 ft8">What happens then?</P>
<P class="p33 ft12">Well, nothing happens until large numbers of men join forces for the avowed pur- pose of ignoring the law, and taking what they want by force.</P>
<P class="p20 ft12">THEN COMES THE DICTATOR, WITH WELL ORGANIZED FIRING SQUADS AND MACHINE GUNS!</P>
<P class="p20 ft10">We have not yet reached that stage in America! But we have heard all we want to know about how the system works. Perhaps we hal1 be fortunate enough not to demand personal knowledge of so gruesome a reality. Doubtless we shall prefer to continue with our</P>
<P class="p13 ft12">FREEDOM OF SPEECH, FREEDOM OF DEED, and FREEDOM TO RENDER USEFUL SERVICE IN RETURN FOR RICHES.</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">The practice, by Government ofﬁcials of extending to men and women the privi- lege of raiding the public treasury in return for votes, sometimes results in elec- tion, but as night follows day, the ﬁnal payoff comes; when every penny wrong- fully used, must be repaid with compound interest on compound interest. If those who make the grab are not forced to repay, the burden falls on their children, and their children’s children, “even unto the third and fourth generations.” There is no way to avoid the debt. Men can, and sometimes do, form themselves into groups for the purpose of crowding wages up, and working hours down. There is a point beyond which they cannot go. It is the point at which the LAW OF ECONOMICS steps in, and the sheriff gets both the employer and the employees.</P>
<P class="p20 ft10">For six years, from 1929, to 1935, the people of America, both rich and poor, barely missed seeing the Old Man Economics hand over to the sheriff all the busi- nesses, and industries and banks. It was not a pretty sight! It did not increase our respect for mob psychology through which men cast reason to the winds and start trying to GET without GIVING.</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">We who went through those six discouraging years, when FEAR WAS IN THE SADDLE, AND FAITH WAS ON THE GROUND, cannot forget how ruthlessly the LAW OF ECONOMICS exacted its toll from both rich and poor, weak and strong, old and young. We shall not wish to go through another such experience.</P>

<P class="p97 ft10">ACCURATE analysis of over 25,000 men and women who had experienced fail- ure, disclosed the fact that LACK OF DECISION was near the head of the list of the 30 major causes of FAILURE. This is no mere statement of a <NOBR>theory-it</NOBR> is a fact. PROCRASTINATION, the opposite of DECISION, is a common enemy which practically every man must conquer.</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">You will have an opportunity to test your capacity to reach quick and deﬁnite DECISIONS when you ﬁnish reading this book, and are ready to begin putting into ACTION the principles which it describes.</P>
<P class="p12 ft10">Analysis of several hundred people who had accumulated fortunes well beyond the million dollar mark, disclosed the fact that every one of them had the habit of REACHING DECISIONS PROMPTLY, and of changing these decisions SLOWLY, if, and when they were changed. People who fail to accumulate money, without exception, have the habit of reaching decisions, IF AT ALL, very slowly, and of changing these decisions quickly and often.</P>
<P class="p20 ft10">One of Henry Ford’s most outstanding qualities is his habit of reaching decisions quickly and deﬁnitely, and changing them slowly. This quality is so pronounced in Mr. Ford, that it has given him the reputation of being obstinate. It was this quality which prompted Mr. Ford to continue to manufacture his famous Model “T” (the world’s ugliest car), when all of his advisors, and many of the purchasers of the car, were urging him to change it.</P>
<P class="p14 ft11">Perhaps, Mr. Ford delayed too long in making the change, but the other side of the story is, that Mr. Ford’s ﬁrmness of decision yielded a huge fortune, before the change in model became necessary. There is but little doubt that Mr. Ford’s habit of deﬁniteness of decision assumes the proportion of obstinacy, but this quality is preferable to slowness in reaching decisions and quickness in changing them.</P>
<P class="p14 ft11">The majority of people who fail to accumulate money sufﬁcient for their needs, are, generally, easily inﬂuenced by the “opinions” of others. They permit the news- papers and the “gossiping” neighbors to do their “thinking” for them. “Opinions are the cheapest commodities on earth. Everyone has a ﬂock of opinions ready to</P>

<P class="p15 ft10">be wished upon anyone who will accept them. If you are inﬂuenced by “opinions” when you reach DECISIONS, you will not succeed in any undertaking, much less in that of transmuting YOUR OWN DESIRE into money.</P>
<P class="p17 ft10">If you are inﬂuenced by the opinions of others, you will have no DESIRE of your own. Keep your own counsel, when you begin to put into practice the principles described here, by reaching your own decisions and following them. Take no one into your conﬁdence, EXCEPT the members of your “Master Mind” group, and be very sure in your selection of this group, that you choose ONLY those who will be in COMPLETE SYMPATHY AND HARMONY WITH YOUR PURPOSE.</P>
<P class="p17 ft10">Close friends and relatives, while not meaning to do so, often handicap one through “opinions” and sometimes through ridicule, which is meant to be hu- morous. Thousands of men and women carry inferiority complexes with them all through life, because some <NOBR>well-meaning,</NOBR> but ignorant person destroyed their conﬁdence through “opinions” or ridicule.</P>
<P class="p17 ft10">You have a brain and mind of your own. USE IT, and reach your own decisions. If you need facts or information from other people, to enable you to reach decisions, as you probably will in many instances; acquire these facts or secure the informa- tion you need quietly, without disclosing your purpose.</P>
<P class="p17 ft10">It is characteristic of people who have but a smattering or a veneer of knowledge to try to give the impression that they have much knowledge. Such people gener- ally do TOO MUCH talking, and TOO LITTLE listening. Keep your eyes and ears wide <NOBR>open-and</NOBR> your mouth CLOSED, if you wish to acquire the habit of prompt DECISION. Those who talk too much do little else. If you talk more than you listen, you not only deprive yourself of many opportunities to accumulate useful knowledge, but you also disclose your PLANS and PURPOSES to people who will take great delight in defeating you, because they envy you.</P>
<P class="p16 ft10">Remember, also, that every time you open your mouth in the presence of a per- son who has an abundance of knowledge, you display to that person, your exact stock of knowledge, or your LACK of it! Genuine wisdom is usually conspicuous through modesty and silence.</P>
<P class="p18 ft10">Keep in mind the fact that every person with whom you associate is, like yourself, seeking the opportunity to accumulate money. If you talk about your plans too freely, you may be surprised when you learn that some other person has beaten you to your goal by PUTTING INTO ACTION AHEAD OF YOU, the plans of which you talked unwisely.</P>

<P class="p19 ft10">Let one of your ﬁrst decisions be to KEEP A CLOSED MOUTH AND OPEN EARS AND EYES. As a reminder to yourself to follow this advice, it will be helpful if you copy the following epigram in large letters and place it where you will see it daily.</P>
<P class="p188 ft16">“TELL THE WORLD WHAT YOU INTEND TO DO, BUT FIRST SHOW</P>
<P class="p189 ft16">IT.”</P>
<P class="p33 ft12">This is the equivalent of saying that “deeds, and not words, are what count most.”</P>
<P class="p118 ft16">FREEDOM OR DEATH ON A DECISION</P>
<P class="p58 ft10">The value of decisions depends upon the courage required to render them. The great decisions, which served as the foundation of civilization, were reached by assuming great risks, which often meant the possibility of death.</P>
<P class="p12 ft10">Lincoln’s decision to issue his famous Proclamation of Emancipation, which gave freedom to the colored people of America, was rendered with full understand- ing that his act would turn thousands of friends and political supporters against him. He knew, too, that the carrying out of that proclamation would mean death to thousands of men on the battleﬁeld. In the end, it cost Lincoln his life. That required courage.</P>
<P class="p20 ft10">Socrates’ decision to drink the cup of poison, rather than compromise in his per- sonal belief, was a decision of courage. It turned Time ahead a thousand years, and gave to people then unborn, the right to freedom of thought and of speech.</P>
<P class="p12 ft10">The decision of Gen. Robert E. Lee, when he came to the parting of the way with the Union, and took up the cause of the South, was a decision of courage, for he well knew that it might cost him his own life, that it would surely cost the lives of others.</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">But, the greatest decision of all time, as far as any American citizen is concerned, was reached in Philadelphia, July 4, 1776, when <NOBR>ﬁfty-six</NOBR> men signed their names to a document, which they well knew would bring freedom to all Americans, or leave every one of the <NOBR>ﬁfty-six</NOBR> hanging from a gallows!</P>
<P class="p12 ft10">You have heard of this famous document, but you may not have drawn from it the great lesson in personal achievement it so plainly taught.</P>

<P class="p15 ft10">We all remember the date of this momentous decision, but few of us realize what courage that decision required. We remember our history, as it was taught; we remember dates, and the names of the men who fought; we remember Valley Forge, and Yorktown; we remember George Washington, and Lord Cornwallis. But we know little of the real forces back of these names, dates, and places. We know still less of that intangible POWER, which insured us freedom long before Washington’s armies reached Yorktown.</P>
<P class="p16 ft10">We read the history of the Revolution, and falsely imagine that George Washing- ton was the Father of our Country, that it was he who won our freedom, while the truth <NOBR>is-Washington</NOBR> was only an accessory after the fact, because victory for his armies had been insured long before Lord Cornwallis surrendered. This is not intended to rob Washington of any of the glory he so richly merited.</P>
<P class="p17 ft10">Its purpose, rather, is to give greater attention to the astounding POWER that was the real cause of his victory. It is nothing short of tragedy that the writers of his- tory have missed, entirely, even the slightest reference to the irresistible POWER, which gave birth and freedom to the nation destined to set up new standards of independence for all the peoples of the earth. I say it is a tragedy, because it is the <NOBR>self-same</NOBR> POWER which must be used by every individual who surmounts the difﬁculties of Life, and forces Life to pay the price asked.</P>
<P class="p16 ft10">Let us brieﬂy review the events which gave birth to this POWER. The story begins with an incident in Boston, March 5, 1770. British soldiers were patroling the streets, by their presence, openly threatening the citizens. The colonists resent- ed armed men marching in their midst. They began to express their resentment openly, hurling stones as well as epithets, at the marching soldiers, until the com- manding ofﬁcer gave orders, “Fix bayonets.....Charge!”</P>
<P class="p17 ft10">The battle was on. It resulted in the death and injury of many. The incident aroused such resentment that the Provincial Assembly, (made up of prominent colonists), called a meeting for the purpose of taking deﬁnite action. Two of the members of that Assembly were, John Hancock, and Samuel <NOBR>Adams-LONG</NOBR> LIVE THEIR NAMES! They spoke up courageously, and declared that a move must be made to eject all British soldiers from Boston.</P>
<P class="p17 ft10">Remember <NOBR>this-a</NOBR> DECISION, in the minds of two men, might properly be called the beginning of the freedom which we, of the United States now enjoy. Remem- ber, too, that the DECISION of these two men called for FAITH, and COURAGE, because it was dangerous.</P>

<P class="p15 ft10">Before the Assembly adjourned, Samuel Adams was appointed to call on the Gov- ernor of the Province, Hutchinson, and demand the withdrawal of the British troops. The request was granted, the troops were removed from Boston, but the incident was not closed. It had caused a situation destined to change the entire trend of civilization. Strange, is it not, how the great changes, such as the Ameri- can Revolution, and the World War, often have their beginnings in circumstances which seem unimportant? It is interesting, also, to observe that these important changes usually begin in the form of a DEFINITE DECISION in the minds of a relatively small number of people. Few of us know the history of our country well enough to realize that John Hancock, Samuel Adams, and Richard Henry Lee (of the Province of Virginia) were the real Fathers of our Country.</P>
<P class="p43 ft10">Richard Henry Lee became an important factor in this story by reason of the fact that he and Samuel Adams communicated frequently (by correspondence), shar- ing freely their fears and their hopes concerning the welfare of the people of their Provinces. From this practice, Adams conceived the idea that a mutual exchange of letters between the thirteen Colonies might help to bring about the coordina- tion of effort so badly needed in connection with the solution of their problems. Two years after the clash with the soldiers in Boston (March `72), Adams pre- sented this idea to the Assembly, in the form of a motion that a Correspondence Committee be established among the Colonies, with deﬁnitely appointed corre- spondents in each Colony, “for the purpose of friendly cooperation for the better- ment of the Colonies of British America.”</P>
<P class="p43 ft10">Mark well this incident! It was the beginning of the organization of the <NOBR>far-ﬂung</NOBR> POWER destined to give freedom to you, and to me. The Master Mind had already been organized. It consisted of Adams, Lee, and Hancock. “I tell you further, that if two of you agree upon the earth concerning anything for which you ask, it will come to you from My Father, who is in Heaven.”</P>
<P class="p44 ft10">The Committee of Correspondence was organized. Observe that this move pro- vided the way for increasing the power of the Master Mind by adding to it men from all the Colonies. Take notice that this procedure constituted the ﬁrst OR- GANIZED PLANNING of the disgruntled Colonists.</P>
<P class="p44 ft10">In union there is strength! The citizens of the Colonies had been waging disorgan- ized warfare against the British soldiers, through incidents similar to the Boston riot, but nothing of beneﬁt had been accomplished. Their individual grievances had not been consolidated under one Master Mind. No group of individuals had put their hearts, minds, souls, and bodies together in one deﬁnite DECISION to settle their difﬁculty with the British once and for all, until Adams, Hancock, and Lee got together.</P>

<P class="p15 ft10">Meanwhile, the British were not idle. They, too, were doing some PLANNING and <NOBR>“Master-Minding”</NOBR> on their own account, with the advantage of having back of them money, and organized soldiery. The Crown appointed Gage to supplant Hutchinson as the Governor of Massachusetts. One of the new Governor’s ﬁrst acts was to send a messenger to call on Samuel Adams, for the purpose of endeav- oring to stop his <NOBR>opposition-by</NOBR> FEAR.</P>
<P class="p17 ft12">We can best understand the spirit of what happened by quoting the conversation between Col. Fenton, (the messenger sent by Gage), and Adams.</P>
<P class="p16 ft10">Col. Fenton: “I have been authorized by Governor Gage, to assure you, Mr. Ad- ams, that the Governor has been empowered to confer upon you such beneﬁts as would be satisfactory, [endeavor to win Adams by promise of bribes], upon the condition that you engage to cease in your opposition to the measures of the government. It is the Governor’s advice to you, Sir, not to incur the further dis- pleasure of his majesty. Your conduct has been such as makes you liable to penal- ties of an Mt of Henry VIII, by which persons can be sent to England for trial for treason, or misprision of treason, at the discretion of a governor of a province. But, BY CHANGING YOUR POLITICAL COURSE, you will not only receive great personal advantages, but you will make your peace with the King.”</P>
<P class="p23 ft10">Samuel Adams had the choice of two DECISIONS. He could cease his opposition, and receive personal bribes, or he could CONTINUE, AND RUN THE RISK OF BEING HANGED!</P>
<P class="p18 ft10">Clearly, the time had come when Adams was forced to reach instantly, a DECI- SION which could have cost his life. The majority of men would have found it difﬁcult to reach such a decision. The majority would have sent back an evasive reply, but not Adams! He insisted upon Col. Fenton’s word of honor, that the Colonel would deliver to the Governor the answer exactly as Adams would give it to him. Adams’ answer, “Then you may tell Governor Gage that I trust I have long since made my peace with the King of Kings. No personal consideration shall in- duce me to abandon the righteous cause of my Country. And, TELL GOVERNOR GAGE IT IS THE ADVICE OF SAMUEL ADAMS TO HIM, no longer to insult the feelings of an exasperated people.”</P>
<P class="p23 ft10">Comment as to the character of this man seems unnecessary. It must be obvious to all who read this astounding message that its sender possessed loyalty of the highest order. This is important. (Racketeers and dishonest politicians have pros- tituted the honor for which such men as Adams died).</P>

<P class="p19 ft10">When Governor Gage received Adams’ caustic reply, he ﬂew into a rage, and is- sued a proclamation which read, “I do, hereby, in his majesty’s name, offer and promise his most gracious pardon to all persons who shall forthwith lay down their arms, and return to the duties of peaceable subjects, excepting only from the beneﬁt of such pardon, SAMUEL ADAMS AND JOHN HANCOCK, whose of- fences are of too ﬂagitious a nature to admit of any other consideration but that of condign punishment.”</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">As one might say, in modern slang, Adams and Hancock were “on the spot!” The threat of the irate Governor forced the two men to reach another DECISION, equally as dangerous. They hurriedly called a secret meeting of their staunchest followers. (Here the Master Mind began to take on momentum). After the meet- ing had been called to order, Adams locked the door, placed the key in his pocket, and informed all present that it was imperative that a Congress of the Colonists be organized, and that NO MAN SHOULD LEAVE THE ROOM UNTIL THE DE-</P>
<P class="p108 ft8">CISION FOR SUCH A CONGRESS HAD BEEN REACHED.</P>
<P class="p33 ft10">Great excitement followed. Some weighed the possible consequences of such radicalism. (Old Man Fear). Some expressed grave doubt as to the wisdom of so deﬁnite a decision in deﬁance of the Crown. Locked in that room were TWO MEN immune to Fear, blind to the possibility of Failure. Hancock and Adams. Through the inﬂuence of their minds, the others were induced to agree that, through the Correspondence Committee, arrangements should be made for a meeting of the First Continental Congress, to be held in Philadelphia, September 5, 1774. Re- member this date. It is more important than July 4, 1776. If there had been no DECISION to hold a Continental Congress, there could have been no signing of the Declaration of Independence.</P>
<P class="p33 ft10">Before the ﬁrst meeting of the new Congress, another leader, in a different sec- tion of the country was deep in the throes of publishing a “Summary View of the Rights of British America.” He was Thomas Jefferson, of the Province of Virginia, whose relationship to Lord Dunmore, (representative of the Crown in Virginia), was as strained as that of Hancock and Adams with their Governor.</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">Shortly after his famous Summary of Rights was published, Jefferson was in- formed that he was subject to prosecution for high treason against his majesty’s government. Inspired by the threat, one of Jefferson’s colleagues, Patrick Henry, boldly spoke his mind, concluding his remarks with a sentence which shall re- main forever a classic, “If this be treason, then make the most of it.”</P>

<P class="p34 ft10">nies, beginning at the opening of the First Continental Congress, and continuing at intervals for two <NOBR>years-until</NOBR> on June 7, 1776, Richard Henry Lee arose, ad- dressed the Chair, and to the startled Assembly made this motion:</P>
<P class="p44 ft10">“Gentlemen, I make the motion that these United Colonies are, and of right ought to be free and independent states, that they be absolved from all allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the state of Great Britain is, and ought to be totally dissolved.”</P>
<P class="p36 ft10">Lee’s astounding motion was discussed fervently, and at such length that he be- gan to lose patience. Finally, after days of argument, he again took the ﬂoor, and declared, in a clear, ﬁrm voice, “Mr. President, we have discussed this issue for days. It is the only course for us to follow. Why, then Sir, do we longer delay? Why still deliberate? Let this happy day give birth to an American Republic. Let her arise, not to devastate and to conquer, but to reestablish the reign of peace, and of law. The eyes of Europe are ﬁxed upon us. She demands of us a living example of freedom, that may exhibit a contrast, in the felicity of the citizen, to the ever increasing tyranny.”</P>
<P class="p23 ft10">Before his motion was ﬁnally voted upon, Lee was called back to Virginia, because of serious family illness, but before leaving, he placed his cause in the hands of his friend, Thomas Jefferson, who promised to ﬁght until favorable action was taken. Shortly thereafter the President of the Congress (Hancock), appointed Jefferson as Chairman of a Committee to draw up a Declaration of Independence.</P>
<P class="p44 ft10">Long and hard the Committee labored, on a document which would mean, when accepted by the Congress, that EVERY MAN WHO SIGNED IT, WOULD BE SIGNING HIS OWN DEATH WARRANT, should the Colonies lose in the ﬁght with Great Britain, which was sure to follow.</P>
<P class="p36 ft10">The document was drawn, and on June 28, the original draft was read before the Congress. For several days it was discussed, altered, and made ready. On July 4, 1776, Thomas Jefferson stood before the Assembly, and fearlessly read the most momentus DECISION ever placed upon paper.</P>
<P class="p44 ft10">“When in the course of human events it is necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume, among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the laws of Nature, and of Nature’s God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation. . .</P>

<P class="p34 ft10">When Jefferson ﬁnished, the document was voted upon, accepted, and signed by the <NOBR>ﬁfty-six</NOBR> men, every one staking his own life upon his DECISION to write his name. By that DECISION came into existence a nation destined to bring to man- kind forever, the privilege of making DECISIONS.</P>
<P class="p44 ft10">By decisions made in a similar spirit of Faith, and only by such decisions, can men solve their personal problems, and win for themselves high estates of material and spiritual wealth. Let us not forget this!</P>
<P class="p36 ft10">Analyze the events which led to the Declaration of Independence, and be con- vinced that this nation, which now holds a position of commanding respect and power among all nations of the world, was born of a DECISION created by a Master Mind, consisting of <NOBR>ﬁfty-six</NOBR> men. Note well, the fact that it was their DE- CISION which insured the success of Washington’s armies, because the spirit of that decision was in the heart of every soldier who fought with him, and served as a spiritual power which recognizes no such thing as FAILURE.</P>
<P class="p35 ft10">Note, also, (with great personal beneﬁt), that the POWER which gave this nation its freedom, is the <NOBR>self-same</NOBR> power that must be used by every individual who becomes <NOBR>self-determining.</NOBR></P>
<P class="p36 ft10">This POWER is made up of the principles described in this book. It will not be difﬁcult to detect, in the story of the Declaration of Independence, at least six of these principles; DESIRE, DECISION, FAITH, PERSISTENCE, THE MASTER MIND, and ORGANIZED PLANNING.</P>
<P class="p44 ft10">Throughout this philosophy will be found the suggestion that thought, backed by strong DESIRE, has a tendency to transmute itself into its physical equivalent. Before passing on, I wish to leave with you the suggestion that one may ﬁnd in this story, and in the story of the organization of the United States Steel Corpora- tion, a perfect description of the method by which thought makes this astounding transformation.</P>
<P class="p17 ft11">In your search for the secret of the method, do not look for a miracle, because you will not ﬁnd it. You will ﬁnd only the eternal laws of Nature. These laws are avail- able to every person who has the FAITH and the COURAGE to use them. They may be used to bring freedom to a nation, or to accumulate riches. There is no charge save the time necessary to understand and appropriate them. Those who reach DECISIONS promptly and deﬁnitely, know what they want, and generally get it. The leaders in every walk of life DECIDE quickly, and ﬁrmly. That is the major reason why they are leaders. The world has the habit of making room for the man whose words and actions show that he knows where he is going.</P>

<P class="p15 ft10">INDECISION is a habit which usually begins in youth. The habit takes on perma- nency as the youth goes through graded school, high school, and even through college, without DEFINITENESS OF PURPOSE. The major weakness of all edu- cational systems is that they neither teach nor encourage the habit of DEFINITE DECISION.</P>
<P class="p17 ft10">It would be beneﬁcial if no college would permit the enrollment of any student, unless and until the student declared his major purpose in matriculating. It would be of still greater beneﬁt, if every student who enters the graded schools were compelled to accept training in the HABIT OF DECISION, and forced to pass a satisfactory examination on this subject before being permitted to advance in the grades.</P>
<P class="p17 ft10">The habit of INDECISION acquired because of the deﬁciencies of our school sys- tems, goes with the student into the occupation he chooses . . . IF . . in fact, he chooses his occupation. Generally, the youth just out of school seeks any job that can be found. He takes the ﬁrst place he ﬁnds, because he has fallen into the habit of INDECISION. <NOBR>Ninety-eight</NOBR> out of every hundred people working for wages today, are in the positions they hold, because they lacked the DEFINITENESS OF DECISION to PLAN A DEFINITE POSITION, and the knowledge of how to choose an employer.</P>
<P class="p16 ft10">DEFINITENESS OF DECISION always requires courage, sometimes very great courage. The <NOBR>ﬁfty-six</NOBR> men who signed the Declaration of Independence staked their lives on the DECISION to afﬁx their signatures to that document. The per- son who reaches a DEFINITE DECISION to procure the particular job, and make life pay the price he asks, does not stake his life on that decision; he stakes his ECONOMIC FREEDOM. Financial independence, riches, desirable business and professional positions are not within reach of the person who neglects or refuses to EXPECT, PLAN, and DEMAND these things. The person who desires riches in the same spirit that Samuel Adams desired freedom for the Colonies, is sure to accumulate wealth.</P>
<P class="p23 ft10">In the chapter on Organized Planning, you will ﬁnd complete instructions for marketing every type of personal services. You will ﬁnd also detailed informa- tion on how to choose the employer you prefer, and the particular job you desire. These instructions will be of no value to you UNLESS YOU DEFINITELY DE- CIDE to organize them into a plan of action.</P>

<P class="p58 ft12">PERSISTENCE is an essential factor in the procedure of transmuting DESIRE into its monetary equivalent. The basis of persistence is the POWER OF WILL.</P>
<P class="p20 ft10"><NOBR>Will-power</NOBR> and desire, when properly combined, make an irresistible pair. Men who accumulate great fortunes are generally known as <NOBR>cold-blooded,</NOBR> and some- times ruthless. Often they are misunderstood. What they have is <NOBR>will-power,</NOBR> which they mix with persistence, and place back of their desires to insure the at- tainment of their objectives.</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">Henry Ford has been generally misunderstood to be ruthless and <NOBR>cold-blooded.</NOBR> This misconception grew out of Ford’s habit of following through in all of his plans with PERSISTENCE.</P>
<P class="p12 ft10">The majority of people are ready to throw their aims and purposes overboard, and give up at the ﬁrst sign of opposition or misfortune. A few carry on DESPITE all opposition, until they attain their goal. These few are the Fords, Carnegies, Rockefellers, and Edisons.</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">There may be no heroic connotation to the word “persistence,” but the quality is to the character of man what carbon is to steel. The building of a fortune, gen- erally, involves the application of the entire thirteen factors of this philosophy. These principles must be understood, they must be applied with PERSISTENCE by all who accumulate money.</P>
<P class="p14 ft10">If you are following this book with the intention of applying the knowledge it con- veys, your ﬁrst test as to your PERSISTENCE will come when you begin to follow the six steps described in the second chapter. Unless you are one of the two out of every hundred who already have a DEFINITE GOAL at which you are aiming, and a DEFINITE PLAN for its attainment, you may read the instructions, and then pass on with your daily routine, and never comply with those instructions.</P>

<P class="p19 ft10">The author is checking you up at this point, because lack of persistence is one of the major causes of failure. Moreover, experience with thousands of people has proved that lack of persistence is a weakness common to the majority of men. It is a weakness which may be overcome by effort. The ease with which lack of persist- ence may be conquered will depend entirely upon the</P>
<P class="p46 ft8">INTENSITY OF ONE’S DESIRE.</P>
<P class="p33 ft10">The starting point of all achievement is DESIRE. Keep this constantly in mind. Weak desires bring weak results, just as a small amount of ﬁre makes a small amount of heat. If you ﬁnd yourself lacking in persistence, this weakness may be remedied by building a stronger ﬁre under your desires.</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">Continue to read through to the end, then go back to Chapter two, and start im- mediately to carry out the instructions given in connection with the six steps. The eagerness with which you follow these instructions will indicate clearly, how much, or how little you really DESIRE to accumulate money. If you ﬁnd that you are indifferent, you may be sure that you have not yet acquired the “money con- sciousness” which you must possess, before you can be sure of accumulating a fortune.</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">Fortunes gravitate to men whose minds have been prepared to “attract” them, just as surely as water gravitates to the ocean. In this book may be found all the stimuli necessary to “attune” any normal mind to the vibrations which will attract the object of one’s desires.</P>
<P class="p14 ft10">If you ﬁnd you are weak in PERSISTENCE, center your attention upon the in- structions contained in the chapter on “Power”; surround yourself with a “MAS- TER MIND” group, and through the cooperative efforts of the members of this group, you can develop persistence. You will ﬁnd additional instructions for the development of persistence in the chapters on <NOBR>auto-suggestion,</NOBR> and the subcon- scious mind. Follow the instructions outlined in these chapters until your habit nature hands over to your subconscious mind, a clear picture of the object of your DESIRE. From that point on, you will not be handicapped by lack of persistence.</P>
<P class="p20 ft10">Your subconscious mind works continuously, while you are awake, and while you are asleep. Spasmodic, or occasional effort to apply the rules will be of no value to you. To get RESULTS, you must apply all of the rules until their application becomes a ﬁxed habit with you. In no other way can you develop the necessary “money consciousness.”</P>

<P class="p19 ft10">POVERTY is attracted to the one whose mind is favorable to it, as money is attract- ed to him whose mind has been deliberately prepared to attract it, and through the same laws. POVERTY CONSCIOUSNESS WILL VOLUNTARILY SEIZE THE MIND WHICH IS NOT OCCUPIED WITH THE MONEY CONSCIOUSNESS. A poverty consciousness develops without conscious application of habits favora- ble to it. The money consciousness must be created to order, unless one is born with such a consciousness.</P>
<P class="p20 ft10">Catch the full signiﬁcance of the statements in the preceding paragraph, and you will understand the importance of PERSISTENCE in the accumulation of a for- tune. Without PERSISTENCE, you will be defeated, even before you start. With PERSISTENCE you will win.</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">If you have ever experienced a nightmare, you will realize the value of persistence. You are lying in bed, half awake, with a feeling that you are about to smother. You are unable to turn over, or to move a muscle. You realize that you MUST BEGIN to regain control over your muscles. Through persistent effort of <NOBR>will-power,</NOBR> you ﬁnally manage to move the ﬁngers of one hand. By continuing to move your ﬁn- gers, you extend your control to the muscles of one arm, until you can lift it. Then you gain control of the other arm in the same manner. You ﬁnally gain control over the muscles of one leg, and then extend it to the other leg. <NOBR>THEN-WITH</NOBR> ONE SUPREME EFFORT OF WILL- you regain complete control over your mus- cular system, and “snap” out of your nightmare. The trick has been turned step by step.</P>
<P class="p58 ft10">You may ﬁnd it necessary to “snap” out of your mental inertia, through a simi- lar procedure, moving slowly at ﬁrst, then increasing your speed, until you gain complete control over your will. Be PERSISTENT no matter how slowly you may, at ﬁrst, have to move.</P>
<P class="p40 ft8">WITH PERSISTENCE WILL COME SUCCESS.</P>
<P class="p33 ft10">If you select your “Master Mind” group with care, you will have in it, at least one person who will aid you in the development of PERSISTENCE. Some men who have accumulated great fortunes, did so because of NECESSITY. They developed the habit of PERSISTENCE, because they were so closely driven by circumstanc- es, that they had to become persistent.</P>
<P class="p14 ft10">THERE IS NO SUBSTITUTE FOR PERSISTENCE! It cannot be supplanted by any other quality! Remember this, and it will hearten you, in the beginning, when the going may seem difﬁcult and slow. Those who have cultivated the HABIT of persistence seem to enjoy insurance against failure. No matter how many times they are defeated, they ﬁnally arrive up toward the top of the ladder.</P>

Those who pick themselves up after defeat and keep on trying, arrive; and the world cries, “Bravo! I knew you could do it!” The hidden Guide lets no one enjoy great achievement without passing the PERSISTENCE TEST. Those who can’t take it, simply do not make the grade.</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">Those who can “take it” are bountifully rewarded for their PERSISTENCE. They receive, as their compensation, whatever goal they are pursuing. That is not all! They receive something inﬁnitely more important than material compensation- the knowledge that</P>
<P class="p191 ft16">“EVERY FAILURE BRINGS WITH IT THE SEED OF AN EQUIVA-</P>
<P class="p192 ft16">LENT ADVANTAGE.”</P>
<P class="p20 ft10">There are exceptions to this rule; a few people know from experience the sound- ness of persistence. They are the ones who have not accepted defeat as being any- thing more than temporary.</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">They are the ones whose DESIRES are so PERSISTENTLY APPLIED that defeat is ﬁnally changed into victory. We who stand on the <NOBR>side-lines</NOBR> of Life see the over- whelmingly large number who go down in defeat, never to rise again. We see the few who take the punishment of defeat as an urge to greater effort. These, fortu- nately, never learn to accept Life’s reverse gear. But what we DO NOT SEE, what most of us never suspect of existing, is the silent but irresistible POWER which comes to the rescue of those who ﬁght on in the face of discouragement. If we speak of this power at all we call it PERSISTENCE, and let it go at that. One thing we all know, if one does not possess PERSISTENCE, one does not achieve noteworthy success in any calling.</P>
<P class="p38 ft11">As these lines are being written, I look up from my work, and see before me, less than a block away, the great mysterious “Broadway,” the “Graveyard of Dead Hopes,” and the “Front Porch of Opportunity.” From all over the world people have come to Broadway, seeking fame, fortune, power, love, or whatever it is that human beings call success. Once in a great while someone steps out from the long procession of seekers, and the world hears that another person has mastered Broadway. But Broadway is not easily nor quickly conquered. She acknowledges talent, recognizes genius, pays off in money, only after one has refused to QUIT.</P>
<P class="p20 ft10">Then we know he has discovered the secret of how to conquer Broadway. The secret is always inseparably attached to one word, PERSISTENCE!</P>

<P class="p19 ft10">The secret is told in the struggle of Fannie Hurst, whose PERSISTENCE con- quered the Great White Way. She came to New York in 1915, to convert writing into riches. The conversion did not come quickly, BUT IT CAME. For four years Miss Hurst learned about “The Sidewalks of New York” from ﬁrst hand experi- ence. She spent her days laboring, and her nights HOPING. When hope grew dim, she did not say, “Alright Broadway, you win!” She said, “Very well, Broadway, you may whip some, but not me. I’m going to force you to give up.”</P>
<P class="p20 ft10">One publisher (The Saturday Evening Post) sent her thirty six rejection slips, be- fore she “broke the ice and got a story across. The average writer, like the “aver- age” in other walks of life, would have given up the job when the ﬁrst rejection slip came. She pounded the pavements for four years to the tune of the publisher’s “NO,” because she was determined to win.</P>
<P class="p14 ft10">Then came the “payoff.” The spell had been broken, the unseen Guide had tested Fannie Hurst, and she could take it. From that time on publishers made a beaten path to her door. Money came so fast she hardly had time to count it. Then the moving picture men discovered her, and money came not in small change, but in ﬂoods. The moving picture rights to her latest novel, “Great Laughter,” brought $100,000.00, said to be the highest price ever paid for a story before publication. Her royalties from the sale of the book probably will run much more.</P>
<P class="p20 ft10">Brieﬂy, you have a description of what PERSISTENCE is capable of achieving. Fannie Hurst is no exception. Wherever men and women accumulate great rich- es, you may be sure they ﬁrst acquired PERSISTENCE. Broadway will give any beggar a cup of coffee and a sandwich, but it demands PERSISTENCE of those who go after the big stakes.</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">Kate Smith will say “amen” when she reads this. For years she sang, without mon- ey, and without price, before any microphone she could reach. Broadway said to her, “Come and get it, if you can take it.” She did take it until one happy day Broadway got tired and said, “Aw, what’s the use? You don’t know when you’re whipped, so name your price, and go to work in earnest.” Miss Smith named her price!</P>
<P class="p13 ft12">It was plenty. Away up in ﬁgures so high that one week’s salary is far more than most people make in a whole year.</P>
<P class="p21 ft8">Verily it pays to be PERSISTENT!</P>
<P class="p33 ft12">And here is an encouraging statement which carries with it a suggestion of great signiﬁcance- THOUSANDS OF SINGERS WHO EXCEL KATE SMITH ARE</P>

<P class="p15 ft10">WALKING UP AND DOWN BROADWAY LOOKING FOR A “BREAK”- WITH- OUT SUCCESS. Countless others have come and gone, many of them sang well enough, but they failed to make the grade because they lacked the courage to keep on keeping on, until Broadway became tired of turning them away. Persistence is a state of mind, therefore it can be cultivated.</P>
<P class="p17 ft10">Like all states of mind, persistence is based upon deﬁnite causes, among them these:-</P>
<P class="p193 ft10"><SPAN class="ft8">a.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft40">DEFINITENESS OF PURPOSE. Knowing what one wants is the ﬁrst and, per- haps, the most important step toward the development of persistence. A strong motive forces one to surmount many difﬁculties.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p194 ft12"><SPAN class="ft8">b.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft50">DESIRE. It is comparatively easy to acquire and to maintain persistence in pursuing the object of intense desire.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p195 ft10"><SPAN class="ft8">c.</SPAN><NOBR><SPAN class="ft35">SELF-RELIANCE.</SPAN></NOBR> Belief in one’s ability to carry out a plan encourages one to follow the plan through with persistence. <NOBR>(Self-reliance</NOBR> can be developed through the principle described in the chapter on <NOBR>auto-suggestion).</NOBR></P>
<P class="p196 ft12"><SPAN class="ft8">d.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft49">DEFINITENESS OF PLANS. Organized plans, even though they may be weak and entirely impractical, encourage persistence.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p195 ft10"><SPAN class="ft8">e.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft40">ACCURATE KNOWLEDGE. Knowing that one’s plans are sound, based upon experience or observation, encourages persistence; “guessing” instead of “know- ing” destroys persistence.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p196 ft10"><SPAN class="ft8">f.</SPAN><NOBR><SPAN class="ft35">CO-OPERATION.</SPAN></NOBR> Sympathy, understanding, and harmonious cooperation with others tend to develop persistence.</P>
<P class="p196 ft10"><SPAN class="ft8">g.</SPAN><NOBR><SPAN class="ft29">WILL-POWER.</SPAN></NOBR> The habit of concentrating one’s thoughts upon the building of plans for the attainment of a deﬁnite purpose, leads to persistence.</P>
<P class="p185 ft10"><SPAN class="ft8">h.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft48">HABIT. Persistence is the direct result of habit. The mind absorbs and be- comes a part of the daily experiences upon which it feeds. Fear, the worst of all enemies, can be effectively cured by forced repetition of cwt8 of courage. Every- one who has seen active service in war knows this.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p197 ft10">Before leaving the subject of PERSISTENCE, take inventory of yourself, and de- termine in what particular, if any, you are lacking in this essential quality. Meas- ure yourself courageously, point by point, and see how many of the eight factors of persistence you lack. The analysis may lead to discoveries that will give you a new grip on yourself.</P>

This enemy belongs at the head of the list, because it generally exists in one’s subconscious mind, where its pres- ence is not recognized. (See the Six Basic Fears in a later chapter).</SPAN></P>
<P class="p110 ft10">Let us examine some of the symptoms of the Fear of Criticism. The majority of people permit relatives, friends, and the public at large to so inﬂuence them that they cannot live their own lives, because they fear criticism.</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">Huge numbers of people make mistakes in marriage, stand by the bargain, and go through life miserable and unhappy, because they fear criticism which may follow if they correct the mistake. (Anyone who has submitted to this form of fear knows the irreparable damage it does, by destroying ambition, <NOBR>self-reliance,</NOBR> and the desire to achieve).</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">Millions of people neglect to acquire belated educations, after having left school, because they fear criticism. Countless numbers of men and women, both young and old, permit relatives to wreck their lives in the name of DUTY, because they fear criticism. (Duty does not require any person to submit to the destruction of his personal ambitions and the right to live his own life in his own way).</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">People refuse to take chances in business, because they fear the criticism which may follow if they fail. The fear of criticism, in such cases is stronger than the DESIRE for success.</P>
<P class="p12 ft10">Too many people refuse to set high goals for themselves, or even neglect selecting a career, because they fear the criticism of relatives and “friends” who may say “Don’t aim so high, people will think you are crazy.</P>
<P class="p60 ft10">When Andrew Carnegie suggested that I devote twenty years to the organization of a philosophy of individual achievement my ﬁrst impulse of thought was fear of what people might say. The suggestion set up a goal for me, far out of proportion</P>

<P class="p34 ft10">to any I had ever conceived. As quick as a ﬂash, my mind began to create alibis and excuses, all of them traceable to the inherent FEAR OF CRITICISM. Some- thing inside of me said, “You can’t do <NOBR>it-the</NOBR> job is too big, and requires too much <NOBR>time-what</NOBR> will your relatives think of you <NOBR>?-how</NOBR> will you earn a <NOBR>living?-no</NOBR> one has ever organized a philosophy of success, what right have you to believe you can do <NOBR>it?-who</NOBR> are you, anyway, to aim so high?- remember your humble <NOBR>birth-what</NOBR> do you know about <NOBR>philosophy-people</NOBR> will think you are <NOBR>crazy-(and</NOBR> they <NOBR>did)-why</NOBR> hasn’t some other person done this before now?”</P>
<P class="p35 ft10">These, and many other questions ﬂashed into my mind, and demanded attention. It seemed as if the whole world had suddenly turned its attention to me with the purpose of ridiculing me into giving up all desire to carry out Mr. Carnegie’s sug- gestion.</P>
<P class="p44 ft10">I had a ﬁne opportunity, then and there, to kill off ambition before it gained con- trol of me. Later in life, after having analyzed thousands of people, I discovered that MOST IDEAS ARE <NOBR>STILL-BORN,</NOBR> AND NEED THE BREATH OF LIFE IN-</P>
<P class="p199 ft11">JECTED INTO THEM THROUGH DEFINITE PLANS OF IMMEDIATE ACTION. The time to nurse an idea is at the time of its birth. Every minute it lives, gives it a better chance of surviving. The FEAR OF CRITICISM is at the bottom of the destruction of most ideas which never reach the PLANNING and ACTION stage.</P>
<P class="p44 ft10">Many people believe that material success is the result of favorable “breaks.” There is an element of ground for the belief, but those depending entirely upon luck, are nearly always disappointed, because they overlook another important factor which must be present before one can be sure of success. It is the knowl- edge with which favorable “breaks” can be made to order.</P>
<P class="p44 ft10">During the depression, W. C. Fields, the comedian, lost all his money, and found himself without income, without a job, and his means of earning a living (vaude- ville) no longer existed. Moreover, he was past sixty, when many men consider themselves “old.” He was so eager to stage a comeback that he offered to work without pay, in a new ﬁeld (movies). In addition to his other troubles, he fell and injured his neck. To many that would have been the place to give up and QUIT. But Fields was PERSISTENT. He knew that if he carried on he would get the “breaks” sooner or later, and he did get them, but not by chance.</P>
<P class="p35 ft10">Marie Dressler found herself down and out, with her money gone, with no job, when she was about sixty. She, too, went after the “breaks,” and got them. Her PERSISTENCE brought an astounding triumph late in life, long beyond the age when most men and women are done with ambition to achieve.</P>

<P class="p39 ft11">Eddie Cantor lost his money in the 1929 stock crash, but he still had his PERSIST- ENCE and his courage. With these, plus two prominent eyes, he exploited himself back into an income of $10,000 a week! Verily, if one has PERSISTENCE, one can get along very well without many other qualities. The only “break” anyone can afford to rely upon is a <NOBR>self-made</NOBR> “break.” These come through the applica- tion of PERSISTENCE. The starting point is DEFINITENESS OF PURPOSE.</P>
<P class="p20 ft10">Examine the ﬁrst hundred people you meet, ask them what they want most in life, and ninety eight of them will not be able to tell you. If you press them for an answer, some will <NOBR>say-SECURITY,</NOBR> many will <NOBR>say-MONEY,</NOBR> a few will <NOBR>say-HAP-</NOBR> PINESS, others will <NOBR>say-FAME</NOBR> AND POWER, and still others will <NOBR>say-SOCIAL</NOBR> RECOGNITION, EASE IN LIVING, ABILITY TO SING, DANCE, or WRITE, but none of them will be able to deﬁne these terms, or give the slightest indication of a PLAN by which they hope to attain these vaguely expressed wishes. Riches do not respond to wishes. They respond only to deﬁnite plans, backed by deﬁnite desires, through constant PERSISTENCE.</P>
<P class="p118 ft16">HOW TO DEVELOP PERSISTENCE</P>
<P class="p33 ft10">There are four simple steps which lead to the habit of PERSISTENCE. They call for no great amount of intelligence, no particular amount of education, and but little time or effort. The necessary steps are:-</P>
<P class="p200 ft10"><SPAN class="ft36">1.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft41">A DEFINITE PURPOSE BACKED BY BURNING DESIRE FOR ITS FULFILL- MENT.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p40 ft8"><SPAN class="ft8">2.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft42">A DEFINITE PLAN, EXPRESSED IN CONTINUOUS ACTION.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p33 ft10"><SPAN class="ft8">3.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft41">A MIND CLOSED TIGHTLY AGAINST ALL NEGATIVE AND DISCOURAG- ING INFLUENCES, including negative suggestions of relatives, friends and ac- quaintances.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p12 ft10"><SPAN class="ft8">4.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft41">A FRIENDLY ALLIANCE WITH ONE OR MORE PERSONS WHO WILL EN- COURAGE ONE TO FOLLOW THROUGH WITH BOTH PLAN AND PURPOSE.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p130 ft10">These four steps are essential for success in all walks of life. The entire purpose of the thirteen principles of this philosophy is to enable one to take these four steps as a matter of habit. These are the steps by which one may control one’s economic destiny. They are the steps that lead to freedom and independence of thought. They are the steps that lead to riches, in small or great quantities. They lead the way to power, fame, and worldly recognition. They are the four steps</P>

<P class="p15 ft10">which guarantee favorable “breaks.” They are the steps that convert dreams into physical realities.</P>
<P class="p193 ft10">They lead, also, to the mastery of FEAR, DISCOURAGEMENT, INDIFFER- ENCE.</P>
<P class="p201 ft10">There is a magniﬁcent reward for all who learn to take these four steps. It is the privilege of writing one’s own ticket, and of making Life yield whatever price is asked.</P>
<P class="p17 ft10">I have no way of knowing the facts, but I venture to conjecture that Mrs. Wallis Simpson’s great love for a man was not accidental, nor the result of favorable “breaks” alone. There was a burning desire, and careful searching at every step of the way. Her ﬁrst duty was to love. What is the greatest thing on earth? The Master called it <NOBR>love-not</NOBR> man made rules, criticism, bitterness, slander, or politi- cal “marriages,” but love.</P>
<P class="p17 ft10">She knew what she wanted, not after she met the Prince of Wales, but long before that. Twice when she had failed to ﬁnd it, she had the courage to continue her search. “To thine own self be true, and it must follow, as the night the day, thou canst not then be false to any man.”</P>
<P class="p17 ft10">Her rise from obscurity was of the slow, progressive, PERSISTENT order, but it was SURE! She triumphed over unbelievably long odds; and, no matter who you are, or what you may think of Wallis Simpson, or the king who gave up his Crown for her love, she is an astounding example of applied PERSISTENCE, an instructor on the rules of <NOBR>self-determination,</NOBR> from whom the entire world might proﬁtably take lessons.</P>
<P class="p17 ft10">When you think of Wallis Simpson, think of one who knew what she wanted, and shook the greatest empire on earth to get it. Women who complain that this is a man’s world, that women do not have an equal chance to win, owe it to them- selves to study carefully the life of this unusual woman, who, at an age which most women consider “old,” captured the affections of the most desirable bachelor in the entire world.</P>
<P class="p17 ft10">And what of King Edward? What lesson may we learn from his part in the world’s greatest drama of recent times? Did he pay too high a price for the affections of the woman of his choice?</P>
<P class="p17 ft12">Surely no one but he can give the correct answer. The rest of us can only conjec- ture. This much we know, the king came into the world without his own consent.</P>

<P class="p34 ft10">He was born to great riches, without requesting them. He was persistently sought in marriage; politicians and statesmen throughout Europe tossed dowagers and princesses at his feet. Because he was the ﬁrst born of his parents, he inherited a crown, which he did not seek, and perhaps did not desire. For more than forty years he was not a free agent, could not live his life in his own way, had but lit- tle privacy, and ﬁnally assumed duties inﬂicted upon him when he ascended the throne.</P>
<P class="p35 ft10">Some will say, “With all these blessings, King Edward should have found peace of mind, contentment, and joy of living.” The truth is that back of all the privileges of a crown, all the money, the fame, and the power inherited by King Edward, there was an emptiness which could be ﬁlled only by love.</P>
<P class="p44 ft10">His greatest DESIRE was for love. Long before he met Wallis Simpson, he doubt- less felt this great universal emotion tugging at the strings of his heart, beating upon the door of his soul, and crying out for expression. And when he met a kin- dred spirit, crying out for this same Holy privilege of expression, he recognized it, and without fear or apology, opened his heart and bade it enter. All the scan- <NOBR>dal-mongers</NOBR> in the world cannot destroy the beauty of this international drama, through which two people found love, and had the courage to face open criticism, renounce ALL ELSE to give it holy expression.</P>
<P class="p35 ft10">King Edward’s DECISION to give up the crown of the world’s most powerful em- pire, for the privilege of going the remainder of the way through life with the woman of his choice, was a decision that required courage. The decision also had a price, but who has the right to say the price was too great? Surely not He who said, “He among you who is without sin, let him cast the ﬁrst stone.”</P>
<P class="p44 ft10">As a suggestion to any <NOBR>evil-minded</NOBR> person who chooses to ﬁnd fault with the Duke of Windsor, because his DESIRE was for LOVE, and for openly declaring his love for Wallis Simpson, and giving up his throne for her, let it be remembered that the OPEN DECLARATION was not essential. He could have followed the custom of clandestine liaison which has prevailed in Europe for centuries, without giving up either his throne, or the woman of his choice, and there would have been NO COMPLAINT FROM EITHER CHURCH OR LAITY. But this unusual man was built of sterner stuff. His love was clean. It was deep and sincere. It represented the one thing which, above ALL ELSE he truly DESIRED, therefore, he took what he wanted, and paid the price demanded.</P>
<P class="p16 ft10">If Europe had been blessed with more rulers with the human heart and the traits of honesty of <NOBR>ex-king</NOBR> Edward, for the past century, that unfortunate hemisphere now seething with greed, hate, lust, political connivance, and threats of war,</P>

<P class="p34 ft10">would have a DIFFERENT AND A BETTER STORY TO TELL. A story in which Love and not Hate would rule.</P>
<P class="p18 ft11">In the words of Stuart Austin Wier we raise our cup and drink this toast to <NOBR>ex-king</NOBR> Edward and Wallis Simpson: “Blessed is the man who has come to know that our muted thoughts are our sweetest thoughts. “Blessed is the man who, from the blackest depths, can see the luminous ﬁgure of LOVE, and seeing, sing; and sing- ing, say: `Sweeter far than uttered lays are the thoughts I have of you.’”</P>
<P class="p44 ft10">In these words would we pay tribute to the two people who, more than all others of modern times, have been the victims of criticism and the recipients of abuse, because they found Life’s greatest treasure, and claimed it. *Mrs. Simpson read and approved this analysis.</P>
<P class="p44 ft10">Most of the world will applaud the Duke of Windsor and Wallis Simpson, because of their PERSISTENCE in searching until they found life’s greatest reward. ALL OF US CAN PROFIT by following their example in our own search for that which we demand of life.</P>
<P class="p17 ft10">What mystical power gives to men of PERSISTENCE the capacity to master dif- ﬁculties? Does the quality of PERSISTENCE set up in one’s mind some form of spiritual, mental or chemical activity which gives one access to supernatural forc- es? Does Inﬁnite Intelligence throw itself on the side of the person who still ﬁghts on, after the battle has been lost, with the whole world on the opposing side?</P>
<P class="p44 ft10">These and many other similar questions have arisen in my mind as I have observed men like Henry Ford, who started at scratch, and built an Industrial Empire of huge proportions, with little else in the way of a beginning but PERSISTENCE. Or, Thomas A. Edison, who, with less than three months of schooling, became the world’s leading inventor and converted PERSISTENCE into the talking machine, the moving picture machine, and the incandescent light, to say nothing of half a hundred other useful inventions.</P>
<P class="p44 ft10">I had the happy privilege of analyzing both Mr. Edison and Mr. Ford, year by year, over a long period of years, and therefore, the opportunity to study them at close range, so I speak from actual knowledge when I say that I found no quality save PERSISTENCE, in either of them, that even remotely suggested the major source of their stupendous achievements.</P>
<P class="p44 ft10">As one makes an impartial study of the prophets, philosophers, “miracle” men, and religious leaders of the past, one is drawn to the inevitable conclusion that PERSISTENCE, concentration of effort, and DEFINITENESS OF PURPOSE, were the major sources of their achievements.</P>

<P class="p19 ft10">Consider, for example, the strange and fascinating story of Mohammed; analyze his life, compare him with men of achievement in this modern age of industry and ﬁnance, and observe how they have one outstanding trait in common, PERSIST- ENCE!</P>
<P class="p12 ft10">If you are keenly interested in studying the strange power which gives potency to PERSISTENCE, read a biography of Mohammed, especially the one by Essad Bey. This brief review of that book, by Thomas Sugrue, in the <NOBR>Herald-Tribune,</NOBR> will provide a preview of the rare treat in store for those who take the time to read the entire story of one of the most astounding examples of the power of PERSIST- ENCE known to civilization.</P>
<P class="p202 ft8">THE LAST GREAT PROPHET</P>
<P class="p203 ft8">Reviewed by Thomas Sugrue</P>
<P class="p119 ft21">“Mohammed was a prophet, but he never performed a miracle. He was not a mystic; he had no formal schooling; he did not begin his mission until he was forty. When he announced that he was the Messenger of God, bringing word of the true religion, he was ridiculed and labeled a lunatic. Children tripped him and women threw ﬁlth upon him. He was banished from his native city, Mecca, and his followers were stripped of their worldly goods and sent into the desert after him. When he had been preaching ten years he had nothing to show for it but banishment, poverty and ridicule. Yet before another ten years had passed, he was dictator of all Arabia, ruler of Mecca, and the head of a New World re- ligion which was to sweep to the Danube and the Pyrenees before exhausting the impetus he gave it. That impetus was <NOBR>three-fold:</NOBR> the power of words, the efﬁcacy of prayer and man’s kinship with God.</P>
<P class="p204 ft30">“His career never made sense. Mohammed was born to impoverished mem- bers of a leading family of Mecca. Because Mecca, the crossroads of the world, home of the magic stone called the Caaba, great city of trade and the center of trade routes, was unsanitary, its children were sent to be raised in the desert by Bedouins. Mohammed was thus nurtured, drawing strength and health from the milk of nomad, vicarious mothers. He tended sheep and soon hired out to a rich widow as leader of her caravans. He traveled to all parts of the Eastern World, talked with many men of diverse beliefs and observed the decline of Christian- ity into warring sects. When he was <NOBR>twenty-eight,</NOBR> Khadija, the widow, looked upon him with favor, and married him. Her father would have objected to such a marriage, so she got him drunk and held him up while he gave the paternal</P>

<P class="p15 ft30">blessing. For the next twelve years Mohammed lived as a rich and respected and very shrewd trader. Then he took to wandering in the desert, and one day he returned with the ﬁrst verse of the Koran and told Khadija that the archangel Gabriel had appeared to him and said that he was to be the Messenger of God.</P>
<P class="p17 ft21">“The Koran, the revealed word of God, was the closest thing to a miracle in Mo- hammed’s life. He had not been a poet; he had no gift of words. Yet the verses of the Koran, as he received them and recited them to the faithful, were better than any verses which the professional poets of the tribes could produce. This, to the Arabs, was a miracle. To them the gift of words was the greatest gift, the poet was <NOBR>all-powerful.</NOBR> In addition the Koran said that all men were equal before God, that the world should be a democratic <NOBR>state-Islam.</NOBR> It was this political her- esy, plus Mohammed’s desire to destroy all the 360 idols in the courtyard of the Caaba, which brought about his banishment. The idols brought the desert tribes to Mecca, and that meant trade. So the business men of Mecca, the capitalists, of which he had been one, set upon Mohammed. Then he retreated to the desert and demanded sovereignty over the world.</P>
<P class="p43 ft21">“The rise of Islam began. Out of the desert came a ﬂame which would not be <NOBR>extinguished-a</NOBR> democratic army ﬁghting as a unit and prepared to die without wincing. Mohammed had invited the Jews and Christians to join him; for he was not building a new religion. He was calling all who believed in one God to join in a single faith. If the Jews and Christians had accepted his invitation Is- lam would have conquered the world. They didn’t. They would not even accept Mohammed’s innovation of humane warfare. When the armies of the prophet entered Jerusalem not a single person was killed because of his faith. When the crusaders entered the city, centuries later, not a Moslem man, woman, or child was spared. But the Christians did accept one Moslem <NOBR>idea-the</NOBR> place of learn- ing, the university.”</P>

<P class="p39 ft10">Knowledge may be acquired from any of the foregoing sources. It may be con- verted into POWER by organizing it into deﬁnite PLANS and by expressing those plans in terms of ACTION. Examination of the three major sources of knowledge will readily disclose the difﬁculty an individual would have, if he depended upon his efforts alone, in assembling knowledge and expressing it through deﬁnite plans in terms of ACTION. If his plans are comprehensive, and if they contem- plate large proportions, he must, generally, induce others to cooperate with him, before he can inject into them the necessary element of POWER.</P>
<P class="p41 ft16">GAINING POWER THROUGH THE “MASTER MIND”</P>
<P class="p129 ft10">The “Master Mind” may be deﬁned as: “Coordination of knowledge and effort, in a spirit of harmony, between two or more people, for the attainment of a deﬁnite purpose.”</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">No individual may have great power without availing himself of the “Master Mind.” In a preceding chapter, instructions were given for the creation of PLANS for the purpose of translating DESIRE into its monetary equivalent. If you carry out these instructions with PERSISTENCE and intelligence, and use discrimina- tion in the selection of your “Master Mind” group, your objective will have been <NOBR>half-way</NOBR> reached, even before you begin to recognize it.</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">So you may better understand the “intangible” potentialities of power available to you, through a properly chosen “Master Mind” group, we will here explain the two characteristics of the Master Mind principle, one of which is economic in nature, and the other psychic. The economic feature is obvious. Economic ad- vantages may be created by any person who surrounds himself with the advice, counsel, and personal cooperation of a group of men who are willing to lend him wholehearted aid, in a spirit of PERFECT HARMONY. This form of cooperative alliance has been the basis of nearly every great fortune. Your understanding of this great truth may deﬁnitely determine your ﬁnancial status.</P>
<P class="p20 ft10">The psychic phase of the Master Mind principle is much more abstract, much more difﬁcult to comprehend, because it has reference to the spiritual forces with which the human race, as a whole, is not well acquainted. You may catch a signiﬁ- cant suggestion from this statement: “No two minds ever come together without, thereby, creating a third, invisible, intangible force which may be likened to a third mind.”</P>
<P class="p38 ft17">Keep in mind the fact that there are only two known elements in the whole uni- verse, energy and matter. It is a well known fact that matter may be broken down</P>

<P class="p12 ft10">Likewise, there are units of energy. The human mind is a form of energy, a part of it being spiritual in nature. When the minds of two people are coordinated in a SPIRIT OF HARMONY, the spiritual units of energy of each mind form an afﬁn- ity, which constitutes the “psychic” phase of the Master Mind.</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">The Master Mind principle, or rather the economic feature of it, was ﬁrst called to my attention by Andrew Carnegie, over <NOBR>twenty-ﬁve</NOBR> years ago. Discovery of this principle was responsible for the choice of my life’s work.</P>
<P class="p12 ft10">Mr. Carnegie’s Master Mind group consisted of a staff of approximately ﬁfty men, with whom he surrounded himself, for the DEFINITE PURPOSE of manufactur- ing and marketing steel. He attributed his entire fortune to the POWER he accu- mulated through this “Master Mind.”</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">Analyze the record of any man who has accumulated a great fortune, and many of those who have accumulated modest fortunes, and you will ﬁnd that they have either consciously, or unconsciously employed the “Master Mind” principle.</P>

<P class="p20 ft10">ENERGY is Nature’s universal set of building blocks, out of which she constructs every material thing in the universe, including man, and every form of animal and vegetable life. Through a process which only Nature completely understands, she translates energy into matter. Nature’s building blocks are available to man, in the energy involved in THINKING! Man’s brain may be compared to an electric battery. It absorbs energy from the ether, which permeates every atom of matter, and ﬁlls the entire universe.</P>
<P class="p20 ft10">It is a well known fact that a group of electric batteries will provide more energy than a single battery. It is also a well known fact that an individual battery will provide energy in proportion to the number and capacity of the cells it contains.</P>
<P class="p12 ft10">The brain functions in a similar fashion. This accounts for the fact that some brains are more efﬁcient than others, and leads to this signiﬁcant <NOBR>statement-a</NOBR> group of brains coordinated (or connected) in a spirit of harmony, will provide more <NOBR>thought-energy</NOBR> than a single brain, just as a group of electric batteries will provide more energy than a single battery.</P>

<P class="p34 ft10">Through this metaphor it becomes immediately obvious that the Master Mind principle holds the secret of the POWER wielded by men who surround them- selves with other men of brains. There follows, now, another statement which will lead still nearer to an understanding of the psychic phase of the Master Mind principle: When a group of individual brains are coordinated and function in Harmony, the increased energy created through that alliance, becomes available to every individual brain in the group.</P>
<P class="p16 ft10">It is a well known fact that Henry Ford began his business career under the handi- cap of poverty, illiteracy, and ignorance. It is an equally well known fact that, within the inconceivably short period of ten years, Mr. Ford mastered these three handicaps, and that within <NOBR>twenty-ﬁve</NOBR> years he made himself one of the rich- est men in America. Connect with this fact, the additional knowledge that Mr. Ford’s most rapid strides became noticeable, from the time he became a personal friend of Thomas A. Edison, and you will begin to understand what the inﬂuence of one mind upon another can accomplish. Go a step farther, and consider the fact that Mr. Ford’s most outstanding achievements began from the time that he formed the acquaintances of Harvey Firestone, John Burroughs, and Luther Burbank, (each a man of great brain capacity), and you will have further evidence that POWER may be produced through friendly alliance of minds.</P>
<P class="p23 ft10">There is little if any doubt that Henry Ford is one of the best informed men in the business and industrial world. The question of his wealth needs no discussion. Analyze Mr. Ford’s intimate personal friends, some of whom have already been mentioned, and you will be prepared to understand the following statement:- “Men take on the nature and the habits and the POWER OF THOUGHT of those with whom they associate in a spirit of sympathy and harmony.”</P>
<P class="p35 ft10">Henry Ford whipped poverty, illiteracy, and ignorance by allying himself with great minds, whose vibrations of thought he absorbed into his own mind. Through his association with Edison, Burbank, Burroughs, and Firestone, Mr. Ford added to his own brain power, the sum and substance of the intelligence, experience, knowledge, and spiritual forces of these four men. Moreover, he appropriated, and made use of the Master Mind principle through the methods of procedure described in this book.</P>
<P class="p44 ft10">This principle is available to you! We have already mentioned Mahatma Gan- dhi. Perhaps the majority of those who have heard of Gandhi, look upon him as merely an eccentric little man, who goes around without formal wearing apparel, and makes trouble for the British Government.</P>
<P class="p44 ft12">In reality, Gandhi is not eccentric, but HE IS THE MOST POWERFUL MAN NOW LIVING.</P>

<P class="p34 ft10">(Estimated by the number of his followers and their faith in their leader.) Moreo- ver, he is probably the most powerful man who has ever lived. His power is pas- sive, but it is real.</P>
<P class="p36 ft10">Let us study the method by which he attained his stupendous POWER. It may be explained in a few words. He came by POWER through inducing over two hun- dred million people to coordinate, with mind and body, in a spirit of HARMONY, for a DEFINITE PURPOSE.</P>
<P class="p44 ft10">In brief, Gandhi has accomplished a MIRACLE, for it is a miracle when two hun- dred million people can be <NOBR>induced-not</NOBR> <NOBR>forced-to</NOBR> cooperate in a spirit of HAR- MONY, for a limitless time. If you doubt that this is a miracle, try to induce ANY TWO PEOPLE to cooperate in a spirit of harmony for any length of time.</P>
<P class="p36 ft10">Every man who manages a business knows what a difﬁcult matter it is to get em- ployees to work together in a spirit even remotely resembling HARMONY.</P>
<P class="p18 ft10">The list of the chief sources from which POWER may be attained is, as you have seen, headed by INFINITE INTELLIGENCE. When two or more people coordi- nate in a spirit of HARMONY, and work toward a deﬁnite objective, they place themselves in position, through that alliance, to absorb power directly from the great universal storehouse of Inﬁnite Intelligence. This is the greatest of all sourc- es of POWER. It is the source to which the genius turns. It is the source to which every great leader turns, (whether he may be conscious of the fact or not).</P>
<P class="p35 ft10">The other two major sources from which the knowledge, necessary for the accu- mulation of POWER, may be obtained are no more reliable than the ﬁve senses of man. The senses are not always reliable. Inﬁnite Intelligence DOES NOT ERR.</P>
<P class="p36 ft10">In subsequent chapters, the methods by which Inﬁnite Intelligence may be most readily contacted will be adequately described. This is not a course on religion. No fundamental principle described in this book should be interpreted as be- ing intended to interfere either directly, or indirectly, with any man’s religious habits. This book has been conﬁned, exclusively, to instructing the reader how to transmute the DEFINITE PURPOSE OF DESIRE FOR MONEY, into its mon- etary equivalent.</P>
<P class="p35 ft10">Read, THINK, and meditate as you read. Soon, the entire subject will unfold, and you will see it in perspective. You are now seeing the detail of the individual chapters.</P>

<P class="p34 ft10">Money is as shy and elusive as the “old time” maiden. It must be wooed and won by methods not unlike those used by a determined lover, in pursuit of the girl of his choice. And, coincidental as it is, the POWER used in the “wooing” of money is not greatly different from that used in wooing a maiden. That power, when successfully used in the pursuit of money must be mixed with FAITH. It must be mixed with DESIRE. It must be mixed with PERSISTENCE. It must be applied through a plan, and that plan must be set into ACTION.</P>
<P class="p35 ft10">When money comes in quantities known as “the big money,” it ﬂows to the one who accumulates it, as easily as water ﬂows down hill. There exists a great unseen stream of POWER, which may be compared to a river; except that one side ﬂows in one direction, carrying all who get into that side of the stream, onward and upward to <NOBR>WEALTH-and</NOBR> the other side ﬂows in the opposite direction, carrying all who are unfortunate enough to get into it (and not able to extricate themselves from it), downward to misery and POVERTY.</P>
<P class="p35 ft10">Every man who has accumulated a great fortune, has recognized the existence of this stream of life. It consists of one’s THINKING PROCESS. The positive emo- tions of thought form the side of the stream which carries one to fortune. The negative emotions form the side which carries one down to poverty. This carries a thought of stupendous importance to the person who is following this book with the object of accumulating a fortune.</P>
<P class="p17 ft10">If you are in the side of the stream of POWER which leads to poverty, this may serve as an oar, by which you may propel yourself over into the other side of the stream. It can serve you ONLY through application and use. Merely reading, and passing judgment on it, either one way or another, will in no way beneﬁt you.</P>
<P class="p44 ft10">Some people undergo the experience of alternating between the positive and negative sides of the stream, being at times on the positive side, and at times on the negative side. The Wall Street crash of `29 swept millions of people from the positive to the negative side of the stream. These millions are struggling, some of them in desperation and fear, to get back to the positive side of the stream. This book was written especially for those millions.</P>
<P class="p17 ft11">Poverty and riches often change places. The Crash taught the world this truth, al- though the world will not long remember the lesson. Poverty may, and generally does, voluntarily take the place of riches. When riches take the place of poverty, the change is usually brought about through well conceived and carefully execut- ed PLANS. Poverty needs no plan. It needs no one to aid it, because it is bold and ruthless. Riches are shy and timid. They have to be “attracted.”</P>

<P class="p150 ft10">The meaning of the word “transmute” is, in simple language, “the changing, or transferring of one element, or form of energy, into another.”</P>
<P class="p211 ft10">The emotion of sex brings into being a state of mind. Because of ignorance on the subject, this state of mind is generally associated with the physical, and because of improper inﬂuences, to which most people have been subjected, in acquiring knowledge of sex, things essentially physical have highly biased the mind.</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">The emotion of sex has back of it the possibility of three constructive potentiali- ties, they are:-</P>
<P class="p212 ft8"><SPAN class="ft36">1.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft25">The perpetuation of mankind.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p96 ft8"><SPAN class="ft8">2.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft27">The maintenance of health, (as a therapeutic agency, it has no equal).</SPAN></P>
<P class="p21 ft8"><SPAN class="ft8">3.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft27">The transformation of mediocrity into genius through transmutation.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p97 ft10">Sex transmutation is simple and easily explained. It means the switching of the mind from thoughts of physical expression, to thoughts of some other nature.</P>
<P class="p12 ft10">Sex desire is the most powerful of human desires. When driven by this desire, men develop keenness of imagination, courage, <NOBR>will-power,</NOBR> persistence, and crea- tive ability unknown to them at other times. So strong and impelling is the desire for sexual contact that men freely run the risk of life and reputation to indulge it. When harnessed, and redirected along other lines, this motivating force main- tains all of its attributes of keenness of imagination, courage, etc., which may be used as powerful creative forces in literature, art, or in any other profession or calling, including, of course, the accumulation of riches.</P>
<P class="p20 ft10">The transmutation of sex energy calls for the exercise of <NOBR>will-power,</NOBR> to be sure, but the reward is worth the effort. The desire for sexual expression is inborn and natural. The desire cannot, and should not be submerged or eliminated. But it should be given an outlet through forms of expression which enrich the body,</P>

<P class="p19 ft10">mind, and spirit of man. If not given this form of outlet, through transmutation, it will seek outlets through purely physical channels.</P>
<P class="p12 ft10">A river may be dammed, and its water controlled for a time, but eventually, it will force an outlet. The same is true of the emotion of sex. It may be submerged and controlled for a time, but its very nature causes it to be ever seeking means of expression. If it is not transmuted into some creative effort it will ﬁnd a less worthy outlet.</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">Fortunate, indeed, is the person who has discovered how to give sex emotion an outlet through some form of creative effort, for he has, by that discovery, lifted himself to the status of a genius.</P>
<P class="p46 ft8">Scientiﬁc research has disclosed these signiﬁcant facts:</P>
<P class="p168 ft10"><SPAN class="ft8">1.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft41">The men of greatest achievement are men with highly developed sex natures; men who have learned the art of sex transmutation.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p12 ft10"><SPAN class="ft8">2.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft34">The men who have accumulated great fortunes and achieved outstanding rec- ognition in literature, art, industry, architecture, and the professions, were moti- vated by the inﬂuence of a woman.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p213 ft10">The research from which these astounding discoveries were made, went back through the pages of biography and history for more than two thousand years. Wherever there was evidence available in connection with the lives of men and women of great achievement, it indicated most convincingly that they possessed highly developed sex natures.</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">The emotion of sex is an “irresistible force,” against which there can be no such opposition as an “immovable body.” When driven by this emotion, men become gifted with a super power for action. Understand this truth, and you will catch the signiﬁcance of the statement that sex transmutation will lift one to the status of a genius.</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">The emotion of sex contains the secret of creative ability. Destroy the sex glands, whether in man or beast, and you have removed the major source of action. For proof of this, observe what happens to any animal after it has been castrated. A bull becomes as docile as a cow after it has been altered sexually. Sex alteration takes out of the male, whether man or beast, all the FIGHT that was in him. Sex alteration of the female has the same effect.</P>

<P class="p8 ft16">THE TEN MIND STIMULI</P>
<P class="p42 ft10">The human mind responds to stimuli, through which it may be “keyed up” to high rates of vibration, known as enthusiasm, creative imagination, intense desire, etc. The stimuli to which the mind responds most freely are:-</P>
<P class="p40 ft8"><SPAN class="ft8">1.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft27">The desire for sex expression</SPAN></P>
<P class="p96 ft8"><SPAN class="ft8">2.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft42">Love</SPAN></P>
<P class="p96 ft8"><SPAN class="ft8">3.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft27">A burning desire for fame, power, or ﬁnancial gain, MONEY</SPAN></P>
<P class="p21 ft8"><SPAN class="ft8">4.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft42">Music</SPAN></P>
<P class="p96 ft8"><SPAN class="ft8">5.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft25">Friendship between either those of the same sex, or those of the opposite sex.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p169 ft12"><SPAN class="ft8">6.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft51">A Master Mind alliance based upon the harmony of two or more people who ally themselves for spiritual or temporal advancement.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p21 ft8"><SPAN class="ft8">7.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft27">Mutual suffering, such as that experienced by people who are persecuted.</SPAN></P>

<P class="p96 ft8"><SPAN class="ft36">10.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft42">Narcotics and alcohol.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p20 ft10">The desire for sex expression comes at the head of the list of stimuli, which most effectively “stepup” the vibrations of the mind and start the “wheels” of physical action. Eight of these stimuli are natural and constructive. Two are destructive. The list is here presented for the purpose of enabling you to make a comparative study of the major sources of mind stimulation. From this study, it will be readily seen that the emotion of sex is, by great odds, the most intense and powerful of all mind stimuli.</P>
<P class="p38 ft11">This comparison is necessary as a foundation for proof of the statement that trans- mutation of sex energy may lift one to the status of a genius. Let us ﬁnd out what constitutes a genius. Some wiseacre has said that a genius is a man who “wears long hair, eats queer food, lives alone, and serves as a target for the joke makers.” A better deﬁnition of a genius is, “a man who has discovered how to increase the vibrations of thought to the point where he can freely communicate with sources of knowledge not available through the ordinary rate of vibration of thought.”</P>

<P class="p19 ft10">The person who thinks will want to ask some questions concerning this deﬁnition of genius. The ﬁrst question will be, “How may one communicate with sources of knowledge which are not available through the ORDINARY rate of vibration of thought?”</P>
<P class="p12 ft10">The next question will be, “Are there known sources of knowledge which are avail- able only to genii, and if so, WHAT ARE THESE SOURCES, and exactly how may they be reached?”</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">We shall offer proof of the soundness of some of the more important statements made in this <NOBR>book-or</NOBR> at least we shall offer evidence through which you may se- cure your own proof through experimentation, and in doing so, we shall answer both of these questions.</P>
<P class="p75 ft16">“GENIUS” IS DEVELOPED THROUGH THE SIXTH SENSE</P>
<P class="p119 ft10">The reality of a “sixth sense” has been fairly well established. This sixth sense is “Creative Imagination.” The faculty of creative imagination is one which the majority of people never use during an entire lifetime, and if used at all, it usu- ally happens by mere accident. A relatively small number of people use, WITH DELIBERATION AND PURPOSE AFORETHOUGHT, the faculty of creative im- agination. Those who use this faculty voluntarily, and with understanding of its functions, are GENII.</P>
<P class="p20 ft10">The faculty of creative imagination is the direct link between the ﬁnite mind of man and Inﬁnite Intelligence. All <NOBR>so-called</NOBR> revelations, referred to in the realm of religion, and all discoveries of basic or new principles in the ﬁeld of invention, take place through the faculty of creative imagination.</P>
<P class="p13 ft12">When ideas or concepts ﬂash into one’s mind, through what is popularly called a “hunch,” they come from one or more of the following sources:-</P>
<P class="p21 ft8"><SPAN class="ft8">1.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft53">Inﬁnite Intelligence</SPAN></P>
<P class="p168 ft10"><SPAN class="ft8">2.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft56">One’s subconscious mind, wherein is stored every sense impression and thought impulse which ever reached the brain through any of the ﬁve senses</SPAN></P>

<P class="p8 ft10"><SPAN class="ft8">4.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft20">From the other person’s subconscious storehouse. There are no other KNOWN sources from which “inspired” ideas or “hunches” may be received.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p18 ft10">The creative imagination functions best when the mind is vibrating (due to some form of mind stimulation) at an exceedingly high rate. That is, when the mind is functioning at a rate of vibration higher than that of ordinary, normal thought.</P>
<P class="p17 ft10">When brain action has been stimulated, through one or more of the ten mind stim- ulants, it has the effect of lifting the individual far above the horizon of ordinary thought, and permits him to envision distance, scope, and quality of THOUGHTS not available on the lower plane, such as that occupied while one is engaged in the solution of the problems of business and professional routine.</P>
<P class="p17 ft10">When lifted to this higher level of thought, through any form of mind stimulation, an individual occupies, relatively, the same position as one who has ascended in an airplane to a height from which he may see over and beyond the horizon line which limits his vision, while on the ground. Moreover, while on this higher level of thought, the individual is not hampered or bound by any of the stimuli which circumscribe and limit his vision while wrestling with the problems of gaining the three basic necessities of food, clothing, and shelter. He is in a world of thought in which the ORDINARY, <NOBR>work-a-day</NOBR> thoughts have been as effectively removed as are the hills and valleys and other limitations of physical vision, when he rises in an airplane.</P>
<P class="p16 ft10">While on this exalted plane of THOUGHT, the creative faculty of the mind is given freedom for action. The way has been cleared for the sixth sense to func- tion, it becomes receptive to ideas which could not reach the individual under any other circumstances. The “sixth sense” is the faculty which marks the difference between a genius and an ordinary individual.</P>
<P class="p17 ft10">The creative faculty becomes more alert and receptive to vibrations, originating outside the individual’s subconscious mind, the more this faculty is used, and the more the individual relies upon it, and makes demands upon it for thought im- pulses. This faculty can be cultivated and developed only through use.</P>
<P class="p17 ft10">That which is known as ones `conscience operates entirely through the faculty of the sixth sense. The great artists, writers, musicians, and poets become great, because they acquire the habit of relying upon the “still small voice” which speaks from within, through the faculty of creative imagination. It is a fact well known to people who have “keen” imaginations that their best ideas come through so- called “hunches.”</P>

<P class="p34 ft10">There is a great orator who does not attain to greatness, until he closes his eyes and begins to rely entirely upon the faculty of Creative Imagination. When asked why he closed his eyes just before the climaxes of his oratory, he replied, “I do it, because, then I speak through ideas which come to me from within.”</P>
<P class="p44 ft12">One of America’s most successful and best known ﬁnanciers followed the habit of closing his eyes for two or three minutes before making a decision.</P>
<P class="p35 ft12">When asked why he did this, he replied, “With my eyes closed, I am able to draw upon a source of superior intelligence.”</P>
<P class="p35 ft10">The late Dr. Elmer R. Gates, of Chevy Chase, Maryland, created more than 200 useful patents, many of them basic, through the process of cultivating and using the creative faculty. His method is both signiﬁcant and interesting to one inter- ested in attaining to the status of genius, in which category Dr. Gates, unques- tionably belonged. Dr. Gates was one of the really great, though less publicized scientists of the world.</P>
<P class="p17 ft10">In his laboratory, he had what he called his “personal communication room.” It was practically sound proof, and so arranged that all light could be shut out. It was equipped with a small table, on which he kept a pad of writing paper. In front of the table, on the wall, was an electric pushbutton, which controlled the lights. When Dr. Gates desired to draw upon the forces available to him through his Creative Imagination, he would go into this room, seat himself at the table, shut off the lights, and CONCENTRATE upon the KNOWN factors of the invention on which he was working, remaining in that position until ideas began to “ﬂash” into his mind in connection with the UNKNOWN factors of the invention.</P>
<P class="p43 ft10">On one occasion, ideas came through so fast that he was forced to write for almost three hours. When the thoughts stopped ﬂowing, and he examined his notes, he found they contained a minute description of principles which bad not a parallel among the known data of the scientiﬁc world.</P>
<P class="p36 ft10">Moreover, the answer to his problem was intelligently presented in those notes. In this manner Dr. Gates completed over 200 patents, which had been begun, but not completed, by <NOBR>“half-baked”</NOBR> brains. Evidence of the truth of this statement is in the United States Patent Ofﬁce.</P>
<P class="p44 ft10">Dr. Gates earned his living by “sitting for ideas” for individuals and corporations. Some of the largest corporations in America paid him substantial fees, by the hour, for “sitting for ideas.”</P>

<P class="p34 ft10">The reasoning faculty is often faulty, because it is largely guided by one’s accu- mulated experience. Not all knowledge, which one accumulates through “expe- rience,” is accurate. Ideas received through the creative faculty are much more reliable, for the reason that they come from sources more reliable than any which are available to the reasoning faculty of the mind.</P>
<P class="p44 ft10">The major difference between the genius and the ordinary “crank” inventor, may be found in the fact that the genius works through his faculty of creative imagina- tion, while the “crank” knows nothing of this faculty. The scientiﬁc inventor (such as Mr. Edison, and Dr. Gates), makes use of both the synthetic and the creative faculties of imagination.</P>
<P class="p44 ft10">For example, the scientiﬁc inventor, or “genius, begins an invention by organizing and combining the known ideas, or principles accumulated through experience, through the synthetic faculty (the reasoning faculty). If he ﬁnds this accumulated knowledge to be insufﬁcient for the completion of his invention, he then draws upon the sources of knowledge available to him through his creative faculty. The method by which he does this varies with the individual, but this is the sum and substance of his procedure:</P>
<P class="p214 ft10"><SPAN class="ft36">1.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft29">HE STIMULATES HIS MIND SO THAT IT VIBRATES ON A </SPAN><NOBR>HIGHER-THAN-</NOBR> AVERAGE PLANE, using one or more of the ten mind stimulants or some other stimulant of his choice.</P>
<P class="p36 ft10"><SPAN class="ft8">2.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft31">HE CONCENTRATES upon the known factors (the ﬁnished part) of his inven- tion, and creates in his mind a perfect picture of unknown factors (the unﬁnished part), of his invention. He holds this picture in mind until it has been taken over by the subconscious mind, then relaxes by clearing his mind of ALL thought, and waits for his answer to “ﬂash” into his mind.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p114 ft10">Sometimes the results are both deﬁnite and immediate. At other times, the re- sults are negative, depending upon the state of development of the “sixth sense,” or creative faculty. Mr. Edison tried out more than 10,000 different combina- tions of ideas through the synthetic faculty of his imagination before he “tuned in” through the creative faculty, and got the answer which perfected the incandes- cent light. His experience was similar when he produced the talking machine.</P>
<P class="p16 ft10">There is plenty of reliable evidence that the faculty of creative imagination exists. This evidence is available through accurate analysis of men who have become leaders in their respective callings, without having had extensive educations. Lin- coln was a notable example of a great leader who achieved greatness, through the discovery, and use of his faculty of creative imagination. He discovered, and</P>

<P class="p17 ft10">The pages of history are ﬁlled with the records of great leaders whose achieve- ments may be traced directly to the inﬂuence of women who aroused the creative faculties of their minds, through the stimulation of sex desire. Napoleon Bona- parte was one of these.</P>
<P class="p18 ft10">When inspired by his ﬁrst wife, Josephine, he was irresistible and invincible. When his “better judgment” or reasoning faculty prompted him to put Josephine aside, he began to decline. His defeat and St. Helena were not far distant.</P>
<P class="p17 ft10">If good taste would permit, we might easily mention scores of men, well known to the American people, who climbed to great heights of achievement under the stimulating inﬂuence of their wives, only to drop back to destruction AFTER money and power went to their heads, and they put aside the old wife for a new one.</P>
<P class="p17 ft10">Napoleon was not the only man to discover that sex inﬂuence, from the right source, is more powerful than any substitute of expediency, which may be created by mere reason.</P>
<P class="p18 ft10">The human mind responds to stimulation! Among the greatest, and most pow- erful of these stimuli is the urge of sex. When harnessed and transmuted, this driving force is capable of lifting men into that higher sphere of thought which enables them to master the sources of worry and petty annoyance which beset their pathway on the lower plane.</P>
<P class="p17 ft10">Unfortunately, only the genii have made the discovery. Others have accepted the experience of sex urge, without discovering one of its major <NOBR>potentialities-a</NOBR> fact which accounts for the great number of “others” as compared to the limited number of genii.</P>
<P class="p17 ft10">For the purpose of refreshing the memory, in connection with the facts available from the biographies of certain men, we here present the names of a few men of outstanding achievement, each of whom was known to have been of a highly sexed nature. The genius which was their’s, undoubtedly found its source of pow- er in transmuted sex energy:</P>

<P class="p13 ft10">Surely no one will misunderstand these statements to mean that ALL who are highly sexed are genii! Man attains to the status of a genius ONLY when, and IF, he stimulates his mind so that it draws upon the forces available, through the creative faculty of the imagination. Chief among the stimuli with which this “step- ping up” of the vibrations may be produced is sex energy. The mere possession of this energy is not sufﬁcient to produce a genius. The energy must be transmuted from desire for physical contact, into some other form of desire and action, be- fore it will lift one to the status of a genius.</P>
<P class="p20 ft10">Far from becoming genii, because of great sex desires, the majority of men lower themselves, through misunderstanding and misuse of this great force, to the sta- tus of the lower animals.</P>

<P class="p8 ft16">WHY MEN SELDOM SUCCEED BEFORE FORTY</P>
<P class="p97 ft10">I discovered, from the analysis of over 25,000 people, that men who succeed in an outstanding way, seldom do so before the age of forty, and more often they do not strike their real pace until they are well beyond the age of ﬁfty. This fact was so astounding that it prompted me to go into the study of its cause most carefully, carrying the investigation over a period of more than twelve years.</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">This study disclosed the fact that the major reason why the majority of men who succeed do not begin to do so before the age of forty to ﬁfty, is their tendency to DISSIPATE their energies through over indulgence in physical expression of the emotion of sex. The majority of men never learn that the urge of sex has other possibilities, which far transcend in importance, that of mere physical expression. The majority of those who make this discovery, do so after having wasted many years at a period when the sex energy is at its height, prior to the age of <NOBR>forty-ﬁve</NOBR> to ﬁfty. This usually is followed by noteworthy achievement.</P>
<P class="p20 ft10">The lives of many men up to, and sometimes well past the age of forty, reﬂect a continued dissipation of energies, which could have been more proﬁtably turned into better channels. Their ﬁner and more powerful emotions are sown wildly to the four winds. Out of this habit of the male, grew the term, “sowing his wild oats.”</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">The desire for sexual expression is by far the strongest and most impelling of all the human emotions, and for this very reason this desire, when harnessed and transmuted into action, other than that of physical expression, may raise one to the status of a genius.</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">One of America’s most able business men frankly admitted that his attractive secretary was responsible for most of the plans he created. He admitted that her presence lifted him to heights of creative imagination, such as he could experi- ence under no other stimulus.</P>
<P class="p12 ft10">One of the most successful men in America owes most of his success to the inﬂu- ence of a very charming young woman, who has served as his source of inspira- tion for more than twelve years.</P>
<P class="p13 ft12">Everyone knows the man to whom this reference is made, but not everyone knows the REAL SOURCE of his achievements.</P>
<P class="p20 ft12">History is not lacking in examples of men who attained to the status of genii, as the result of the use of artiﬁcial mind stimulants in the form of alcohol and nar-</P>

<P class="p15 ft10">cotics. Edgar Allen Poe wrote the “Raven” while under the inﬂuence of liquor, “dreaming dreams that mortal never dared to dream before.” James Whitcomb Riley did his best writing while under the inﬂuence of alcohol. Perhaps it was thus he saw “the ordered intermingling of the real and the dream, the mill above the river, and the mist above the stream.” Robert Burns wrote best when intoxicated, “For Auld Lang Syne, my dear, we’ll take a cup of kindness yet, for Auld Lang Syne.” But let it be remembered that many such men have destroyed themselves in the end. Nature has prepared her own potions with which men may safely stimulate their minds so they vibrate on a plane that enables them to tune in to ﬁne and rare thoughts which come <NOBR>from-no</NOBR> man knows where! No satisfactory substitute for Nature’s stimulants has ever been found.</P>
<P class="p23 ft10">It is a fact well known to psychologists that there is a very close relationship be- tween sex desires and spiritual <NOBR>urges-a</NOBR> fact which accounts for the peculiar be- havior of people who participate in the orgies known as religious “revivals,” com- mon among the primitive types.</P>
<P class="p17 ft10">The world is ruled, and the destiny of civilization is established, by the human emotions. People are inﬂuenced in their actions, not by reason so much as by “feelings.” The creative faculty of the mind is set into action entirely by emotions, and not by cold reason. The most powerful of all human emotions is that of sex. There are other mind stimulants, some of which have been listed, but no one of them, nor all of them combined, can equal the driving power of sex.</P>
<P class="p17 ft10">A mind stimulant is any inﬂuence which will either temporarily, or permanently, increase the vibrations of thought. The ten major stimulants, described, are those most commonly resorted to.</P>
<P class="p17 ft10">Through these sources one may commune with Inﬁnite Intelligence, or enter, at will, the storehouse of the subconscious mind, either one’s own, or that of another person, a procedure which is all there is of genius.</P>
<P class="p18 ft10">A teacher, who has trained and directed the efforts of more than 30,000 sales peo- ple, made the astounding discovery that highly sexed men are the most efﬁcient salesmen. The explanation is, that the factor of personality known as “personal magnetism” is nothing more nor less than sex energy. Highly sexed people always have a plentiful supply of magnetism. Through cultivation and understanding, this vital force may be drawn upon and used to great advantage in the relation- ships between people. This energy may be communicated to others through the following media:</P>

<P class="p216 ft10">When employing salesmen, the more capable sales manager looks for the quality of personal magnetism as the ﬁrst requirement of a salesman. People who lack sex energy will never become enthusiastic nor inspire others with enthusiasm, and enthusiasm is one of the most important requisites in salesmanship, no mat- ter what one is selling.</P>
<P class="p17 ft10">The public speaker, orator, preacher, lawyer, or salesman who is lacking in sex energy is a “ﬂop,” as far as being able to inﬂuence others is concerned. Couple with this the fact, that most people can be inﬂuenced only through an appeal to their emotions, and you will understand the importance of sex energy as a part of the salesman’s native ability. Master salesmen attain the status of mastery in sell- ing, because they, either consciously, or unconsciously, transmute the energy of sex into SALES ENTHUSIASM! In this statement may be found a very practical suggestion as to the actual meaning of sex transmutation.</P>
<P class="p16 ft10">The salesman who knows how to take his mind off the subject of sex, and direct it in sales effort with as much enthusiasm and determination as he would apply to its original purpose, has acquired the art of sex transmutation, whether he knows it or not.</P>
<P class="p17 ft12">The majority of salesmen who transmute their sex energy do so without being in the least aware of what they are doing, or how they are doing it.</P>
<P class="p16 ft12">Transmutation of sex energy calls for more will power than the average person cares to use for this purpose. Those who ﬁnd it difﬁcult to summon <NOBR>will-power</NOBR></P>

<P class="p34 ft10">sufﬁcient for transmutation, may gradually acquire this ability. Though this re- quires <NOBR>will-power,</NOBR> the reward for the practice is more than worth the effort. The entire subject of sex is one with which the majority of people appear to be unpar- donably ignorant. The urge of sex has been grossly misunderstood, slandered, and burlesqued by the ignorant and the evil minded, for so long that the very word sex is seldom used in polite society. Men and women who are known to be <NOBR>blessed-yes,</NOBR> <NOBR>BLESSED-with</NOBR> highly sexed natures, are usually looked upon as be- ing people who will bear watching. Instead of being called blessed, they are usu- ally called cursed.</P>
<P class="p43 ft10">Millions of people, even in this age of enlightenment, have inferiority complexes which they developed because of this false belief that a highly sexed nature is a curse. These statements, of the virtue of sex energy, should not be construed as justiﬁcation for the libertine. The emotion of sex is a virtue ONLY when used in- telligently, and with discrimination. It may be misused, and often is, to such an extent that it debases, instead of enriches, both body and mind. The better use of this power is the burden of this chapter.</P>
<P class="p17 ft11">It seemed quite signiﬁcant to the author, when he made the discovery that practi- cally every great leader, whom he had the privilege of analyzing, was a man whose achievements were largely inspired by a woman. In many instances, the “woman in the case” was a modest, <NOBR>self-denying</NOBR> wife, of whom the public had heard but little or nothing. In a few instances, the source of inspiration has been traced to the “other woman.” Perhaps such cases may not be entirely unknown to you.</P>
<P class="p35 ft10">Intemperance in sex habits is just as detrimental as intemperance in habits of drinking and eating. In this age in which we live, an age which began with the world war, intemperance in habits of sex is common. This orgy of indulgence may account for the shortage of great leaders. No man can avail himself of the forces of his creative imagination, while dissipating them. Man is the only creature on earth which violates Nature’s purpose in this connection. Every other animal in- dulges its sex nature in moderation, and with purpose which harmonizes with the laws of nature. Every other animal responds to the call of sex only in “season.” Man’s inclination is to declare “open season.”</P>
<P class="p35 ft10">Every intelligent person knows that stimulation in excess, through alcoholic drink and narcotics, is a form of intemperance which destroys the vital organs of the body, including the brain. Not every person knows, however, that over indul- gence in sex expression may become a habit as destructive and as detrimental to creative effort as narcotics or liquor.</P>

<P class="p34 ft10">A <NOBR>sex-mad</NOBR> man is not essentially different than a <NOBR>dope-mad</NOBR> man! Both have lost control over their faculties of reason and <NOBR>will-power.</NOBR> Sexual overindulgence may not only destroy reason and <NOBR>will-power,</NOBR> but it may also lead to either temporary, or permanent insanity. Many cases of hypochondria (imaginary illness) grow out of habits developed in ignorance of the true function of sex.</P>
<P class="p44 ft10">From these brief references to the subject, it may be readily seen that ignorance on the subject of sex transmutation, forces stupendous penalties upon the igno- rant on the one hand, and withholds from them equally stupendous beneﬁts, on the other.</P>
<P class="p44 ft10">Widespread ignorance on the subject of sex is due to the fact that the subject has been surrounded with mystery and beclouded by dark silence. The conspiracy of mystery and silence has had the same effect upon the minds of young people that the psychology of prohibition had. The result has been increased curiosity, and desire to acquire more knowledge on this “verboten” subject; and to the shame of all lawmakers, and most <NOBR>physicians-by</NOBR> training best qualiﬁed to educate youth on that <NOBR>subject-information</NOBR> has not been easily available.</P>
<P class="p35 ft10">Seldom does an individual enter upon highly creative effort in any ﬁeld of en- deavor before the age of forty. The average man reaches the period of his great- est capacity to create between forty and sixty. These statements are based upon analysis of thousands of men and women who have been carefully observed. They should be encouraging to those who fail to arrive before the age of forty, and to those who become frightened at the approach of “old age,” around the forty- year mark. The years between forty and ﬁfty are, as a rule, the most fruitful. Man should approach this age, not with fear and trembling, but with hope and eager anticipation.</P>
<P class="p35 ft10">If you want evidence that most men do not begin to do their best work before the age of forty, study the records of the most successful men known to the American people, and you will ﬁnd it.</P>
<P class="p36 ft10">Henry Ford had not “hit his pace” of achievement until he had passed the age of forty. Andrew Carnegie was well past forty before he began to reap the reward of his efforts.</P>
<P class="p217 ft10">James J. Hill was still running a telegraph key at the age of forty. His stupendous achievements took place after that age. Biographies of American industrialists and ﬁnanciers are ﬁlled with evidence that the period from forty to sixty is the most productive age of man. Between the ages of thirty and forty, man begins to learn (if he ever learns), the art of sex transmutation. This discovery is generally</P>

<P class="p15 ft10">accidental, and more often than otherwise, the man who makes it is totally un- conscious of his discovery. He may observe that his powers of achievement have increased around the age of <NOBR>thirty-ﬁve</NOBR> to forty, but in most cases, he is not famil- iar with the cause of this change; that Nature begins to harmonize the emotions of love and sex in the individual, between the ages of thirty and forty, so that he may draw upon these great forces, and apply them jointly as stimuli to action.</P>
<P class="p35 ft10">Sex, alone, is a mighty urge to action, but its forces are like a <NOBR>cyclone-they</NOBR> are often uncontrollable. When the emotion of love begins to mix itself with the emo- tion of sex, the result is calmness of purpose, poise, accuracy of judgment, and balance. What person, who has attained to the age of forty, is so unfortunate as to be unable to analyze these statements, and to corroborate them by his own experience?</P>
<P class="p44 ft10">When driven by his desire to please a woman, based solely upon the emotion of sex, a man may be, and usually is, capable of great achievement, but his actions may be disorganized, distorted, and totally destructive. When driven by his desire to please a woman, based upon the motive of sex alone, a man may steal, cheat, and even commit murder. But when the emotion of LOVE is mixed with the emo- tion of sex, that same man will guide his actions with more sanity, balance, and reason.</P>
<P class="p35 ft10">Criminologists have discovered that the most hardened criminals can be reformed through the inﬂuence of a woman’s love. There is no record of a criminal having been reformed solely through the sex inﬂuence. These facts are well known, but their cause is not. Reformation comes, if at all, through the heart, or the emo- tional side of man, not through his head, or reasoning side.</P>
<P class="p44 ft10">Reformation means, “a change of heart.” It does not mean a “change of head.” A man may, because of reason, make certain changes in his personal conduct to avoid the consequences of undesirable effects, but GENUINE REFORMA- TION comes only through a change of <NOBR>heart-through</NOBR> a DESIRE to change. Love, Romance, and Sex are all emotions capable of driving men to heights of super achievement. Love is the emotion which serves as a safety valve, and insures bal- ance, poise, and constructive effort. When combined, these three emotions may lift one to an altitude of a genius. There are genii, however, who know but little of the emotion of love. Most of them may be found engaged in some form of ac- tion which is destructive, or at least, not based upon justice and fairness toward others. If good taste would permit, a dozen genii could be named in the ﬁeld of industry and ﬁnance, who ride ruthlessly over the rights of their fellow men. They seem totally lacking in conscience. The reader can easily supply his own list of such men.</P>

<P class="p19 ft10">The emotions are states of mind. Nature has provided man with a “chemistry of the mind” which operates in a manner similar to the principles of chemistry of matter. It is a well known fact that, through the aid of chemistry of matter, a chemist may create a deadly poison by mixing certain elements, none of which <NOBR>are-in</NOBR> <NOBR>themselves-harmful</NOBR> in the right proportions. The emotions may, likewise, be combined so as to create a deadly poison. The emotions of sex and jealousy, when mixed, may turn a person into an insane beast.</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">The presence of any one or more of the destructive emotions in the human mind, through the chemistry of the mind, sets up a poison which may destroy one’s sense of justice and fairness. In extreme cases, the presence of any combination of these emotions in the mind may destroy one’s reason.</P>
<P class="p13 ft12">The road to genius consists of the development, control, and use of sex, love, and romance. Brieﬂy, the process may be stated as follows:</P>
<P class="p20 ft10">Encourage the presence of these emotions as the dominating thoughts in one’s mind, and discourage the presence of all the destructive emotions. The mind is a creature of habit. It thrives upon the dominating thoughts fed it. Through the faculty of <NOBR>will-power,</NOBR> one may discourage the presence of any emotion, and en- courage the presence of any other. Control of the mind, through the power of will, is not difﬁcult. Control comes from persistence, and habit. The secret of control lies in understanding the process of transmutation. When any negative emotion presents itself in one’s mind, it can be transmuted into a positive, or constructive emotion, by the simple procedure of changing one’s thoughts.</P>
<P class="p218 ft16">THERE IS NO OTHER ROAD TO GENIUS THAN THROUGH VOLUN-</P>
<P class="p192 ft16">TARY SELF EFFORT!</P>
<P class="p20 ft10">A man may attain to great heights of ﬁnancial or business achievement, solely by the driving force of sex energy, but history is ﬁlled with evidence that he may, and usually does, carry with him certain traits of character which rob him of the ability to either hold, or enjoy his fortune. This is worthy of analysis, thought, and meditation, for it states a truth, the knowledge of which may be helpful to women as well as men. Ignorance of this has cost thousands of people their privilege of HAPPINESS, even though they possessed riches.</P>
<P class="p38 ft11">The emotions of love and sex leave their unmistakable marks upon the features. Moreover, these signs are so visible, that all who wish may read them. The man who is driven by the storm of passion, based upon sex desires alone, plainly ad- vertises that fact to the entire world, by the expression of his eyes, and the lines of his face. The emotion of love, when mixed with the emotion of sex, softens, modi-</P>

<P class="p15 ft10">ﬁes, and beautiﬁes the facial expression. No character analyst is needed to tell you this- you may observe it for yourself.</P>
<P class="p18 ft10">The emotion of love brings out, and develops, the artistic and the aesthetic nature of man. It leaves its impress upon one’s very soul, even after the ﬁre has been subdued by time and circumstance.</P>
<P class="p17 ft10">Memories of love never pass. They linger, guide, and inﬂuence long after the source of stimulation has faded. There is nothing new in this. Every person, who has been moved by GENUINE LOVE, knows that it leaves enduring traces upon the human heart. The effect of love endures, because love is spiritual in nature. The man who cannot be stimulated to great heights of achievement by love, is <NOBR>hopeless-he</NOBR> is dead, though he may seem to live.</P>
<P class="p17 ft10">Even the memories of love are sufﬁcient to lift one to a higher plane of creative ef- fort. The major force of love may spend itself and pass away, like a ﬁre which has burned itself out, but it leaves behind indelible marks as evidence that it passed that way. Its departure often prepares the human heart for a still greater love. Go back into your yesterdays, at times, and bathe your mind in the beautiful memo- ries of past love. It will soften the inﬂuence of the present worries and annoy- ances. It will give you a source of escape from the unpleasant realities of life, and <NOBR>maybe-who</NOBR> <NOBR>knows?-your</NOBR> mind will yield to you, during this temporary retreat into the world of fantasy, ideas, or plans which may change the entire ﬁnancial or spiritual status of your life.</P>
<P class="p23 ft10">If you believe yourself unfortunate, because you have “loved and lost,” perish the thought. One who has loved truly, can never lose entirely. Love is whimsical and temperamental. Its nature is ephemeral, and transitory. It comes when it pleases, and goes away without warning. Accept and enjoy it while it remains, but spend no time worrying about its departure. Worry will never bring it back.</P>
<P class="p17 ft10">Dismiss, also, the thought that love never comes but once. Love may come and go, times without number, but there are no two love experiences which affect one in just the same way. There may be, and there usually is, one love experience which leaves a deeper imprint on the heart than all the others, but all love experiences are beneﬁcial, except to the person who becomes resentful and cynical when love makes its departure.</P>
<P class="p17 ft10">There should be no disappointment over love, and there would be none if peo- ple understood the difference between the emotions of love and sex. The major difference is that love is spiritual, while sex is biological. No experience, which touches the human heart with a spiritual force, can possibly be harmful, except through ignorance, or jealousy.</P>

<P class="p34 ft10">Love is, without question, life’s greatest experience. It brings one into commun- ion with Inﬁnite Intelligence. When mixed with the emotions of romance and sex, it may lead one far up the ladder of creative effort. The emotions of love, sex, and romance, are sides of the eternal triangle of <NOBR>achievement-building</NOBR> genius. Nature creates genii through no other force.</P>
<P class="p44 ft10">Love is an emotion with many sides, shades, and colors. The love which one feels for parents, or children is quite different from that which one feels for one’s sweet- heart. The one is mixed with the emotion of sex, while the other is not.</P>
<P class="p36 ft12">The love which one feels in true friendship is not the same as that felt for one’s sweetheart, parents, or children, but it, too, is a form of love.</P>
<P class="p35 ft10">Then, there is the emotion of love for things inanimate, such as the love of Nature’s handiwork. But the most intense and burning of all these various kinds of love, is that experienced in the blending of the emotions of love and sex. Marriages, not blessed with the eternal afﬁnity of love, properly balanced and proportioned, with sex, cannot be happy <NOBR>ones-and</NOBR> seldom endure. Love, alone, will not bring happiness in marriage, nor will sex alone. When these two beautiful emotions are blended, marriage may bring about a state of mind, closest to the spiritual that one may ever know on this earthly plane.</P>
<P class="p35 ft12">When the emotion of romance is added to those of love and sex, the obstructions between the ﬁnite mind of man and Inﬁnite Intelligence are removed.</P>
<P class="p16 ft10">Then a genius has been born! What a different story is this, than those usually as- sociated with the emotion of sex. Here is an interpretation of the emotion which lifts it out of the commonplace, and makes of it potter’s clay in the hands of God, from which He fashions all that is beautiful and inspiring. It is an interpretation which would, when properly understood, bring harmony out of the chaos which exists in too many marriages. The disharmonies often expressed in the form of nagging, may usually be traced to lack of knowledge on the subject of sex. Where love, romance and the proper understanding of the emotion and function of sex abide, there is no disharmony between married people.</P>
<P class="p35 ft10">Fortunate is the husband whose wife understands the true relationship between the emotions of love, sex, and romance. When motivated by this holy triumvirate, no form of labor is burdensome, because even the most lowly form of effort takes on the nature of a labor of love.</P>

<P class="p15 ft10">It is a very old saying that “a man’s wife may either make him or break him,” but the reason is not always understood. The “making” and “breaking” is the result of the wife’s understanding, or lack of understanding of the emotions of love, sex, and romance. Despite the fact that men are polygamous, by the very nature of their biological inheritance, it is true that no woman has as great an inﬂuence on a man as his wife, unless he is married to a woman totally unsuited to his nature. If a woman permits her husband to lose interest in her, and become more interested in other women, it is usually because of her ignorance, or indifference toward the subjects of sex, love, and romance. This statement presupposes, of course, that genuine love once existed between a man and his wife.</P>
<P class="p43 ft10">The facts are equally applicable to a man who permits his wife’s interest in him to die. Married people often bicker over a multitude of trivialities. If these are analyzed accurately, the real cause of the trouble will often be found to be indif- ference, or ignorance on these subjects. Man’s greatest motivating force is his desire to please woman! The hunter who excelled during prehistoric days, before the dawn of civilization, did so, because of his desire to appear great in the eyes of woman. Man’s nature has not changed in this respect. The “hunter” of today brings home no skins of wild animals, but he indicates his desire for her favor by supplying ﬁne clothes, motor cars, and wealth. Man has the same desire to please woman that he had before the dawn of civilization. The only thing that has changed, is his method of pleasing. Men who accumulate large fortunes, and attain to great heights of power and fame, do so, mainly, to satisfy their desire to please women.</P>
<P class="p219 ft10">Take women out of their lives, and great wealth would be useless to most men. It is this inherent desire of man to please woman, which gives woman the power to make or break a man.</P>
<P class="p36 ft10">The woman who understands man’s nature and tactfully caters to it, need have no fear of competition from other women. Men may be “giants” with indomita- ble <NOBR>will-power</NOBR> when dealing with other men, but they are easily managed by the women of their choice.</P>
<P class="p17 ft11">Most men will not admit that they are easily inﬂuenced by the women they prefer, because it is in the nature of the male to want to be recognized as the stronger of the species. Moreover, the intelligent woman recognizes this “manly trait” and very wisely makes no issue of it. Some men know that they are being inﬂuenced by the women of their <NOBR>choice-their</NOBR> wives, sweethearts, mothers or <NOBR>sisters-but</NOBR> they tactfully refrain from rebelling against the inﬂuence because they are in- telligent enough to know that NO MAN IS HAPPY OR COMPLETE WITHOUT THE MODIFYING INFLUENCE OF THE RIGHT WOMAN.

<P class="p97 ft10">THE SUBCONSCIOUS MIND consists of a ﬁeld of consciousness, in which every impulse of thought that reaches the objective mind through any of the ﬁve senses, is classiﬁed and recorded, and from which thoughts may be recalled or withdrawn as letters may be taken from a ﬁling cabinet.</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">It receives, and ﬁles, sense impressions or thoughts, regardless of their nature. You may VOLUNTARILY plant in your subconscious mind any plan, thought, or purpose which you desire to translate into its physical or monetary equivalent. The subconscious acts ﬁrst on the dominating desires which have been mixed with emotional feeling, such as faith.</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">Consider this in connection with the instructions given in the chapter on DESIRE, for taking the six steps there outlined, and the instructions given in the chapter on the building and execution of plans, and you will understand the importance of the thought conveyed.</P>
<P class="p75 ft16">THE SUBCONSCIOUS MIND WORKS DAY AND NIGHT.</P>
<P class="p20 ft13">Through a method of procedure, unknown to man, the subconscious mind draws upon the forces of Inﬁnite Intelligence for the power with which it voluntarily transmutes one’s desires into their physical equivalent, making use, always of the most practical media by which this end may be accomplished.</P>
<P class="p59 ft10">You cannot entirely control your subconscious mind, but you can voluntarily hand over to it any plan, desire, or purpose which you wish transformed into concrete form. Read, again, instructions for using the subconscious mind, in the chapter on autosuggestion.</P>
<P class="p14 ft11">There is plenty of evidence to support the belief that the subconscious mind is the connecting link between the ﬁnite mind of man and Inﬁnite Intelligence.

<P class="p20 ft10">I never approach the discussion of the subconscious mind without a feeling of lit- tleness and inferiority due, perhaps, to the fact that man’s entire stock of knowl- edge on this subject is so pitifully limited. The very fact that the subconscious mind is the medium of communication between the thinking mind of man and Inﬁnite Intelligence is, of itself, a thought which almost paralyzes one’s reason.</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">After you have accepted, as a reality, the existence of the subconscious mind, and understand its possibilities, as a medium for transmuting your DESIRES into their physical or monetary equivalent, you will comprehend the full signiﬁcance of the instructions given in the chapter on DESIRE. You will also understand why you have been repeatedly admonished to MAKE YOUR DESIRES CLEAR, AND TO REDUCE THEM TO WRITING.</P>

Remember, your sub- conscious mind functions voluntarily, whether you make any effort to inﬂuence it or not. This, naturally, suggests to you that thoughts of fear and poverty, and all negative thoughts serve as stimuli to your subconscious mind, unless, you master these impulses and give it more desirable food upon which it may feed.</P>
<P class="p20 ft10">The subconscious mind will not remain idle! If you fail to plant DESIRES in your subconscious mind, it will feed upon the thoughts which reach it as the result of your neglect. We have already explained that thought impulses, both negative and positive are reaching the subconscious mind continuously, from the four sources which were mentioned in the chapter on Sex Transmutation.</P>
<P class="p13 ft12">For the present, it is sufﬁcient if you remember that you are living daily, in the midst of all manner of thought impulses which are reaching your subconscious</P>

<P class="p19 ft10">mind, without your knowledge. Some of these impulses are negative, some are positive. You are now engaged in trying to help shut oil the ﬂow of negative im- pulses, and to aid in voluntarily inﬂuencing your subconscious mind, through positive impulses of DESIRE.</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">When you achieve this, you will possess the key which unlocks the door to your subconscious mind. Moreover, you will control that door so completely, that no undesirable thought may inﬂuence your subconscious mind.</P>
<P class="p12 ft10">Everything which man creates, BEGINS in the form of a thought impulse. Man can create nothing which he does not ﬁrst conceive in THOUGHT. Through the aid of the imagination, thought impulses may be assembled into plans. The im- agination, when under control, may be used for the creation of plans or purposes that lead to success in one’s chosen occupation.</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">All thought impulses, intended for transmutation into their physical equivalent, voluntarily planted in the subconscious mind, must pass through the imagina- tion, and be mixed with faith. The “mixing” of faith with a plan, or purpose, in- tended for submission to the subconscious mind, may be done ONLY through the imagination.</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">From these statements, you will readily observe that voluntary use of the subcon- scious mind calls for coordination and application of all the principles.</P>
<P class="p12 ft10">Ella Wheeler Wilcox gave evidence of her understanding of the power of the sub- conscious mind when she wrote:</P>
<P class="p222 ft23">“You never can tell what a thought will do</P>
<P class="p223 ft23">In bringing you hate or love-</P>
<P class="p224 ft23">For thoughts are things, and their airy wings</P>
<P class="p92 ft23">Are swifter than carrier doves.</P>
<P class="p225 ft23">They follow the law of the universe-</P>
<P class="p226 ft23">Each thing creates its kind,</P>
<P class="p227 ft23">And they speed O’er the track to bring you back</P>
<P class="p228 ft23">Whatever went out from your mind.”</P>
<P class="p129 ft10">Mrs. Wilcox understood the truth, that thoughts which go out from one’s mind, also imbed themselves deeply in one’s subconscious mind, where they serve as a magnet, pattern, or blueprint by which the subconscious mind is inﬂuenced while translating them into their physical equivalent. Thoughts are truly things, for the reason that every material thing begins in the form of <NOBR>thought-energy.</NOBR></P>

<P class="p19 ft10">The subconscious mind is more susceptible to inﬂuence by impulses of thought mixed with “feeling” or emotion, than by those originating solely in the reason- ing portion of the mind. In fact, there is much evidence to support the theory, that ONLY emotionalized thoughts have any ACTION inﬂuence upon the subcon- scious mind.</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">It is a well known fact that emotion or feeling, rules the majority of people. If it is true that the subconscious mind responds more quickly to, and is inﬂuenced more readily by thought impulses which are well mixed with emotion, it is essen- tial to become familiar with the more important of the emotions. There are seven major positive emotions, and seven major negative emotions. The negatives vol- untarily inject themselves into the thought impulses, which insure passage into the subconscious mind. The positives must be injected, through the principle of <NOBR>auto-suggestion,</NOBR> into the thought impulses which an individual wishes to pass on to his subconscious mind. (Instructions have been given in the chapter on auto- suggestion.)</P>
<P class="p33 ft10">These emotions, or feeling impulses, may be likened to yeast in a loaf of bread, because they constitute the ACTION element, which transforms thought impuls- es from the passive to the active state. Thus may one understand why thought impulses, which have been well mixed with emotion, are acted upon more readily than thought impulses originating in “cold reason.”</P>
<P class="p14 ft10">You are preparing yourself to inﬂuence and control the “inner audience” of your subconscious mind, in order to hand over to it the DESIRE for money, which you wish transmuted into its monetary equivalent. It is essential, therefore, that you understand the method of approach to this “inner audience.” You must speak its language, or it will not heed your call. It understands best the language of emo- tion or feeling. Let us, therefore describe here the seven major positive emotions, and the seven major negative emotions, so that you may draw upon the positives, and avoid the negatives, when giving instructions to your subconscious mind.</P>
<P class="p21 ft8">THE SEVEN MAJOR POSITIVE EMOTIONS</P>
<P class="p96 ft8">The emotion of DESIRE</P>

<P class="p19 ft10">There are other positive emotions, but these are the seven most powerful, and the ones most commonly used in creative effort. Master these seven emotions (they can be mastered only by USE), and the other positive emotions will be at your command when you need them. Remember, in this connection, that you are studying a book which is intended to help you develop a “money <NOBR>conscious-ness”</NOBR> by ﬁlling your mind with positive emotions. One does not become money con- scious by ﬁlling one’s mind with negative emotions.</P>
<P class="p229 ft12">THE SEVEN MAJOR NEGATIVE EMOTIONS (To be avoided)</P>

<P class="p42 ft10">Positive and negative emotions cannot occupy the mind at the same time. One or the other must dominate. It is your responsibility to make sure that positive emo- tions constitute the dominating inﬂuence of your mind. Here the law of HABIT will come to your aid.</P>
<P class="p12 ft10">Form the habit of applying and using the positive emotions! Eventually, they will dominate your mind so completely, that the negatives cannot enter it.</P>
<P class="p12 ft10">Only by following these instructions literally, and continuously, can you gain control over your subconscious mind. The presence of a single negative in your conscious mind is sufﬁcient to destroy all chances of constructive aid from your subconscious mind.</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">If you are an observing person, you must have noticed that most people resort to prayer ONLY after everything else has FAILED! Or else they pray by a ritual of meaningless words. And, because it is a fact that most people who pray, do so ONLY AFTER EVERYTHING ELSE HAS FAILED, they go to prayer with their minds ﬁlled with FEAR and DOUBT, which are the emotions the subconscious mind acts upon, and passes on to Inﬁnite Intelligence.</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">Likewise, that is the emotion which Inﬁnite Intelligence receives, and ACTS UPON.</P>

<P class="p34 ft10">If you pray for a thing, but have fear as you pray, that you may not receive it, or that your prayer will not be acted upon by Inﬁnite Intelligence, your prayer will have been in vain.</P>
<P class="p44 ft10">Prayer does, sometimes, result in the realization of that for which one prays. If you have ever had the experience of receiving that for which YOU prayed, go back in your memory, and recall your actual STATE OF MIND, while you were praying, and you will know, for sure, that the theory here described is more than a theory.</P>
<P class="p44 ft10">The time will come when the schools and educational institutions of the coun- try will teach the “science of prayer.” Moreover, then prayer may be, and will be reduced to a science. When that time comes, (it will come as soon as mankind is ready for it, and demands it), no one will approach the Universal Mind in a state of fear, for the very good reason that there will be no such emotion as fear. Ignorance, superstition, and false teaching will have disappeared, and man will have attained his true status as a child of Inﬁnite Intelligence. A few have already attained this blessing.</P>
<P class="p35 ft10">If you believe this prophesy is <NOBR>far-fetched,</NOBR> take a look at the human race in retrospect. Less than a hundred years ago, men believed the lightning to be evidence of the wrath of God, and feared it. Now, thanks to the power of FAITH, men have harnessed the lightning and made it turn the wheels of industry. Much less than a hundred years ago, men believed the space between the planets to be nothing but a great void, a stretch of dead nothingness. Now, thanks to this same power of FAITH, men know that far from being either dead or a void, the space between the planets is very much alive, that it is the highest form of vibration known, excepting, perhaps, the vibration of THOUGHT. Moreover, men know that this living, pulsating, vibratory energy which permeates every atom of mat- ter, and ﬁlls every niche of space, connects every human brain with every other human brain.</P>
<P class="p43 ft10">What reason have men to believe that this same energy does not connect every human brain with Inﬁnite Intelligence? There are no <NOBR>toll-gates</NOBR> between the ﬁnite mind of man and Inﬁnite Intelligence. The communication costs nothing except Patience, Faith, Persistence, Understanding, and a SINCERE DESIRE to commu- nicate. Moreover, the approach can be made only by the individual himself. Paid prayers are worthless. Inﬁnite Intelligence does no business by proxy. You either go direct, or you do not communicate.</P>

<P class="p15 ft10">dergo transformation, such as can be given only through your own subconscious mind. The method by which you may communicate with Inﬁnite Intelligence is very similar to that through which the vibration of sound is communicated by radio. If you understand the working principle of radio, you of course, know that sound cannot be communicated through the ether until it has been “stepped up,” or changed into a rate of vibration which the human ear cannot detect.</P>
<P class="p16 ft10">The radio sending station picks up the sound of the human voice, and “scram- bles,” or modiﬁes it by stepping up the vibration millions of times. Only in this way, can the vibration of sound be communicated through the ether. After this transformation has taken place, the ether “picks up” the energy (which originally was in the form of vibrations of sound), carries that energy to radio receiving sta- tions, and these receiving sets “step” that energy back down to its original rate of vibration so it is recognized as sound.</P>
<P class="p17 ft10">The subconscious mind is the intermediary, which translates one’s prayers into terms which Inﬁnite Intelligence can recognize, presents the message, and brings back the answer in the form of a deﬁnite plan or idea for procuring the object of the prayer.</P>
<P class="p17 ft10">Understand this principle, and you will know why mere words read from a prayer book cannot, and will never serve as an agency of communication between the mind of man and Inﬁnite Intelligence.</P>
<P class="p18 ft10">Before your prayer will reach Inﬁnite Intelligence (a statement of the author’s theory only), it probably is transformed from its original thought vibration into terms of spiritual vibration. Faith is the only known agency which will give your thoughts a spiritual nature. FAITH and FEAR make poor bedfellows. Where one is found, the other cannot exist.</P>

<P class="p58 ft10">MORE than twenty years ago, the author, working in conjunction with the late Dr. Alexander Graham Bell, and Dr. Elmer R. Gates, observed that every human brain is both a broadcasting and receiving station for the vibration of thought.</P>
<P class="p12 ft10">Through the medium of the ether, in a fashion similar to that employed by the ra- dio broadcasting principle, every human brain is capable of picking up vibrations of thought which are being released by other brains.</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">In connection with the statement in the preceding paragraph, compare, and con- sider the description of the Creative Imagination, as outlined in the chapter on Imagination. The Creative Imagination is the “receiving set” of the brain, which receives thoughts, released by the brains of others. It is the agency of communi- cation between one’s conscious, or reasoning mind, and the four sources from which one may receive thought stimuli.</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">When stimulated, or “stepped up” to a high rate of vibration, the mind becomes more receptive to the vibration of thought which reaches it through the ether from outside sources. This “stepping up” process takes place through the posi- tive emotions, or the negative emotions. Through the emotions, the vibrations of thought may be increased.</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">Vibrations of an exceedingly high rate are the only vibrations picked up and car- ried, by the ether, from one brain to another. Thought is energy travelling at an exceedingly high rate of vibration. Thought, which has been modiﬁed or “stepped up” by any of the major emotions, vibrates at a much higher rate than ordinary thought, and it is this type of thought which passes from one brain to another, through the broadcasting machinery of the human brain.</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">The emotion of sex stands at the head of the list of human emotions, as far as intensity and driving force are concerned. The brain which has been stimulated by the emotion of sex, vibrates at a much more rapid rate than it does when that emotion is quiescent or absent.</P>

<P class="p19 ft10">The result of sex transmutation, is the increase of the rate of vibration of thoughts to such a pitch that the Creative Imagination becomes highly receptive to ideas, which it picks up from the ether.</P>
<P class="p12 ft10">On the other hand, when the brain is vibrating at a rapid rate, it not only attracts thoughts and ideas released by other brains through the medium of the ether, but it gives to one’s own thoughts that “feeling” which is essential before those thoughts will be picked up and acted upon by one’s subconscious mind.</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">Thus, you will see that the broadcasting principle is the factor through which you mix feeling, or emotion with your thoughts and pass them on to your subcon- scious mind.</P>
<P class="p12 ft10">The subconscious mind is the “sending station” of the brain, through which vibra- tions of thought are broadcast. The Creative Imagination is the “receiving set,” through which the vibrations of thought are picked up from the ether.</P>
<P class="p12 ft10">Along with the important factors of the subconscious mind, and the faculty of the Creative Imagination, which constitute the sending and receiving sets of your mental broadcasting machinery, consider now the principle of <NOBR>auto-suggestion,</NOBR> which is the medium by which you may put into operation your “broadcasting” station.</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">Through the instructions described in the chapter on <NOBR>auto-suggestion,</NOBR> you were deﬁnitely informed of the method by which DESIRE may be transmuted into its monetary equivalent.</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">Operation of your mental “broadcasting” station is a comparatively simple pro- cedure. You have but three principles to bear in mind, and to apply, when you wish to use your broadcasting <NOBR>station-the</NOBR> SUBCONSCIOUS MIND, CREATIVE IMAGINATION, and <NOBR>AUTO-SUGGESTION.</NOBR> The stimuli through which you put these three principles into action have been <NOBR>described-the</NOBR> procedure begins with</P>
<P class="p62 ft8">DESIRE.</P>
<P class="p41 ft16">THE GREATEST FORCES ARE “INTANGIBLE”</P>
<P class="p232 ft10">The depression brought the world to the very <NOBR>border-line</NOBR> of understanding of the forces which are intangible and unseen. Through the ages which have passed, man has depended too much upon his physical senses, and has limited his knowl- edge to physical things, which he could see, touch, weigh, and measure.</P>

<P class="p19 ft10">We are now entering the most marvelous of all <NOBR>ages-an</NOBR> age which will teach us something of the intangible forces of the world about us. Perhaps we shall learn, as we pass through this age, that the “other self” is more powerful than the physi- cal self we see when we look into a mirror.</P>
<P class="p12 ft10">Sometimes men speak lightly of the intangibles- the things which they cannot perceive through any of their ﬁve senses, and when we hear them, it should re- mind us that all of us are controlled by forces which are unseen and intangible.</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">The whole of mankind has not the power to cope with, nor to control the intangi- ble force wrapped up in the rolling waves of the oceans. Man has not the capacity to understand the intangible force of gravity, which keeps this little earth sus- pended in <NOBR>mid-air,</NOBR> and keeps man from falling from it, much less the power to control that force. Man is entirely subservient to the intangible force which comes with a thunder storm, and he is just as helpless in the presence of the intangible force of electricity- nay, he does not even know what electricity is, where it comes from, or what is its purpose!</P>
<P class="p20 ft10">Nor is this by any means the end of man’s ignorance in connection with things unseen and intangible. He does not understand the intangible force (and intel- ligence) wrapped up in the soil of the <NOBR>earth-the</NOBR> force which provides him with every morsel of food he eats, every article of clothing he wears, every dollar he carries in his pockets.</P>
<P class="p75 ft16">THE DRAMATIC STORY OF THE BRAIN</P>
<P class="p58 ft10">Last, but not least, man, with all of his boasted culture and education, under- stands little or nothing of the intangible force (the greatest of all the intangibles) of thought. He knows but little concerning the physical brain, and its vast net- work of intricate machinery through which the power of thought is translated into its material equivalent, but he is now entering an age which shall yield enlighten- ment on the subject. Already men of science have begun to turn their attention to the study of this stupendous thing called a brain, and, while they are still in the kindergarten stage of their studies, they have uncovered enough knowledge to know that the central switchboard of the human brain, the number of lines which connect the brain cells one with another, equal the ﬁgure one, followed by ﬁfteen million ciphers.</P>
<P class="p33 ft10">“The ﬁgure is so stupendous,” said Dr. C. Judson Herrick, of the University of Chicago, “that astronomical ﬁgures dealing with hundreds of millions of light years, become insigniﬁcant by comparison.</P>

<P class="p15 ft10">It has been determined that there are from 10,000,000,000 to 14,000,000,000 nerve cells in the human cerebral cortex, and we know that these are arranged in deﬁnite patterns. These arrangements are not haphazard. They are orderly. Recently developed methods of <NOBR>electro-physiology</NOBR> draw off action currents from very precisely located cells, or ﬁbers with <NOBR>micro-electrodes,</NOBR> amplify them with radio tubes, and record potential differences to a millionth of a volt.”</P>
<P class="p44 ft10">It is inconceivable that such a network of intricate machinery should be in ex- istence for the sole purpose of carrying on the physical functions incidental to growth and maintenance of the physical body. Is it not likely that the same sys- tem, which gives billions of brain cells the media for communication one with an- other, provides, also the means of communication with other intangible forces?</P>
<P class="p44 ft10">After this book had been written, just before the manuscript went to the publish- er, there appeared in the New York Times, an editorial showing that at least one great University, and one intelligent investigator in the ﬁeld of mental phenom- ena, are carrying on an organized research through which conclusions have been reached that parallel many of those described in this and the following chapter. The editorial brieﬂy analyzed the work carried on by Dr. Rhine, and his associates at Duke University, viz:- “What is `Telepathy’?</P>
<P class="p16 ft10">“A month ago we cited on this page some of the remarkable results achieved by Professor Rhine and his associates in Duke University from more than a hun- dred thousand tests to determine the existence of `telepathy’ and `clairvoyance.’ These results were summarized in the ﬁrst two articles in Harpers Magazine. In the second which has now appeared, the author, E. H. Wright, attempts to sum- marize what has been learned, or what it seems reasonable to infer, regarding the exact nature of these `extrasensory’ modes of perception.</P>
<P class="p44 ft10">“The actual existence of telepathy and clairvoyance now seems to some scientists enormously probable as the result of Rhine’s experiments. Various percipients were asked to name as many cards in a special pack as they could without look- ing at them and without other sensory access to them. About a score of men and women were discovered who could regularly name so many of the cards correctly that `there was not one chance in many a million million of their having done their feats by luck or accident.’</P>
<P class="p16 ft11">“But how did they do them? These powers, assuming that they exist, do not seem to be sensory. There is no known organ for them. The experiments worked just as well at distances of several hundred miles as they did in the same room. These facts also dispose, in Mr. Wright’s opinion, of the attempt to explain telepathy or</P>

<P class="p34 ft10">clairvoyance through any physical theory of radiation. All known forms of radiant energy decline inversely as the square of the distance traversed. Telepathy and clairvoyance do not. But they do vary through physical causes as our other mental powers do.</P>
<P class="p44 ft10">Contrary to widespread opinion, they do not improve when the percipient is asleep or <NOBR>half-asleep,</NOBR> but, on the contrary, when he is most <NOBR>wide-awake</NOBR> and alert. Rhine discovered that a narcotic will invariably lower a percipient’s score, while a stimulant will always send it higher. The most reliable performer apparently can- not make a good score unless he tries to do his best.</P>
<P class="p17 ft10">“One conclusion that Wright draws with some conﬁdence is that telepathy and clairvoyance are really one and the same gift. That is, the faculty that `sees’ a card face down on a table seems to be exactly the same one that `reads’ a thought re- siding only in another mind. There are several grounds for believing this. So far, for example, the two gifts have been found in every person who enjoys either of them. In every one so far the two have been of equal vigor, almost exactly. Screens, walls, distances, have no effect at all on either. Wright advances from this con- clusion to express what he puts forward as no more than the mere `hunch’ that other <NOBR>extra-sensory</NOBR> experiences, prophetic dreams, premonitions of disaster, and the like, may also prove to be part of the same faculty. The reader is not asked to accept any of these conclusions unless he ﬁnds it necessary, but the evidence that Rhine has piled up must remain impressive.”</P>
<P class="p43 ft10">In view of Dr. Rhine’s announcement in connection with the conditions under which the mind responds to what he terms <NOBR>“extra-sensory</NOBR> modes of perception, I now feel privileged to add to his testimony by stating that my associates and I have discovered what we believe to be the ideal conditions under which the mind can be stimulated so that the sixth sense described in the next chapter, can be made to function in a practical way.</P>
<P class="p35 ft10">The conditions to which I refer consist of a close working alliance between myself and two members of my staff. Through experimentation and practice, we have discovered how to stimulate our minds (by applying the principle used in con- nection with the “Invisible Counselors” described in the next chapter) so that we can, by a process of blending our three minds into one, ﬁnd the solution to a great variety of personal problems which are submitted by my clients.</P>
<P class="p17 ft10">The procedure is very simple. We sit down at a conference table, clearly state the nature of the problem we have under consideration, then begin discussing it. Each contributes whatever thoughts that may occur. The strange thing about this method of mind stimulation is that it places each participant in communication with unknown sources of knowledge deﬁnitely outside his own experience.</P>

<P class="p97 ft10">THE “thirteenth” principle is known as the SIXTH SENSE, through which Inﬁ- nite Intelligence may, and will communicate voluntarily, without any effort from, or demands by, the individual.</P>
<P class="p12 ft10">This principle is the apex of the philosophy. It can be assimilated, understood, and applied ONLY by ﬁrst mastering the other twelve principles.</P>
<P class="p12 ft13">The SIXTH SENSE is that portion of the subconscious mind which has been re- ferred to as the Creative Imagination. It has also been referred to as the “receiving set” through which ideas, plans, and thoughts ﬂash into the mind. The “ﬂashes” are sometimes called “hunches” or “inspirations.”</P>
<P class="p59 ft10">The sixth sense deﬁes description! It cannot be described to a person who has not mastered the other principles of this philosophy, because such a person has no knowledge, and no experience with which the sixth sense may be compared. Un- derstanding of the sixth sense comes only by meditation through mind develop- ment from within. The sixth sense probably is the medium of contact between the ﬁnite mind of man and Inﬁnite Intelligence, and for this reason, it is a mixture of both the mental and the spiritual. It is believed to be the point at which the mind of man contacts the Universal Mind.</P>
<P class="p20 ft10">After you have mastered the principles described in this book, you will be pre- pared to accept as truth a statement which may, otherwise, be incredible to you, namely:</P>
<P class="p12 ft10">Through the aid of the sixth sense, you will be warned of impending dangers in time to avoid them, and notiﬁed of opportunities in time to embrace them.</P>
<P class="p12 ft10">There comes to your aid, and to do your bidding, with the development of the sixth sense, a “guardian angel” who will open to you at all times the door to the Temple of Wisdom.</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">Whether or not this is a statement of truth, you will never know, except by follow- ing the instructions described in the pages of this book, or some similar method of procedure.</P>

<P class="p15 ft10">The author is not a believer in, nor an advocate of “miracles,” for the reason that he has enough knowledge of Nature to understand that Nature never deviates from her established laws.</P>
<P class="p18 ft10">Some of her laws are so incomprehensible that they produce what appear to be “miracles.” The sixth sense comes as near to being a miracle as anything I have ever experienced, and it appears so, only because I do not understand the method by which this principle is operated.</P>
<P class="p17 ft10">This much the author does <NOBR>know-that</NOBR> there is a power, or a First Cause, or an Intelligence, which permeates every atom of matter, and embraces every unit of energy perceptible to <NOBR>man-that</NOBR> this Inﬁnite Intelligence converts acorns into oak trees, causes water to ﬂow down hill in response to the law of gravity, follows night with day, and winter with summer, each maintaining its proper place and relationship to the other. This Intelligence may, through the principles of this philosophy, be induced to aid in transmuting DESIRES into concrete, or material form. The author has this knowledge, because he has experimented with it- and has EXPERIENCED IT.</P>
<P class="p16 ft10">Step by step, through the preceding chapters, you have been led to this, the last principle. If you have mastered each of the preceding principles, you are now prepared to accept, without being skeptical, the stupendous claims made here. If you have not mastered the other principles, you must do so before you may determine, deﬁnitely, whether or not the claims made in this chapter are fact or ﬁction.</P>
<P class="p17 ft10">While I was passing through the age of <NOBR>“hero-worship”</NOBR> I found myself trying to imitate those whom I most admired. Moreover, I discovered that the element of FAITH, with which I endeavored to imitate my idols, gave me great capacity to do so quite successfully.</P>
<P class="p17 ft10">I have never entirely divested myself of this habit of <NOBR>hero-worship,</NOBR> although I have passed the age commonly given over to such. My experience has taught me that the next best thing to being truly great, is to emulate the great, by feeling and action, as nearly as possible.</P>
<P class="p17 ft10">Long before I had ever written a line for publication, or endeavored to deliver a speech in public, I followed the habit of reshaping my own character, by trying to imitate the nine men whose lives and <NOBR>life-works</NOBR> had been most impressive to me. These nine men were, Emerson, Paine, Edison, Darwin, Lincoln, Burbank, Napoleon, Ford, and Carnegie.</P>

<P class="p19 ft12">Every night, over a long period of years, I held an imaginary Council meeting with this group whom I called my “Invisible Counselors.”</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">The procedure was this. Just before going to sleep at night, I would shut my eyes, and see, in my imagination, this group of men seated with me around my Council Table. Here I had not only an opportunity to sit among those whom I considered to be great, but I actually dominated the group, by serving as the Chairman.</P>
<P class="p12 ft10">I had a very DEFINITE PURPOSE in indulging my imagination through these nightly meetings. My purpose was to rebuild my own character so it would rep- resent a composite of the characters of my imaginary counselors. Realizing, as I did, early in life, that I had to overcome the handicap of birth in an environment of ignorance and superstition, I deliberately assigned myself the task of voluntary rebirth through the method here described.</P>
<P class="p118 ft16">BUILDING CHARACTER THROUGH <NOBR>AUTO-SUGGESTION</NOBR></P>
<P class="p142 ft10">Being an earnest student of psychology, I knew, of course, that all men have become what they are, because of their DOMINATING THOUGHTS AND DE- SIRES. I knew that every deeply seated desire has the effect of causing one to seek outward expression through which that desire may be transmuted into reality. I knew that <NOBR>self-suggestion</NOBR> is a powerful factor in building character, that it is, in fact, the sole principle through which character is builded.</P>
<P class="p14 ft10">With this knowledge of the principles of mind operation, I was fairly well armed with the equipment needed in rebuilding my character. In these imaginary Coun- cil meetings I called on my Cabinet members for the knowledge I wished each to contribute, addressing myself to each member in audible words, as follows:</P>
<P class="p13 ft21">“Mr. Emerson, I desire to acquire from you the marvelous understanding of Nature which distinguished your life. I ask that you make an impress upon my subconscious mind, of whatever qualities you possessed, which enabled you to understand and adapt yourself to the laws of Nature. I ask that you assist me in reaching and drawing upon whatever sources of knowledge are available to this end.</P>
<P class="p13 ft21">“Mr. Burbank, I request that you pass on to me the knowledge which enabled you to so harmonize the laws of Nature that you caused the cactus to shed its thorns, and become an edible food.</P>

<P class="p34 ft10">months of this nightly procedure, I was astounded by the discovery that these imaginary ﬁgures became, apparently real.</P>
<P class="p36 ft10">Each of these nine men developed individual characteristics, which surprised me. For example, Lincoln developed the habit of always being late, then walking around in solemn parade. When he came, he walked very slowly, with his hands clasped behind him, and once in a while, he would stop as he passed, and rest his hand, momentarily, upon my shoulder. He always wore an expression of serious- ness upon his face. Rarely did I see him smile. The cares of a sundered nation made him grave.</P>
<P class="p35 ft10">That was not true of the others. Burbank and Paine often indulged in witty repar- tee which seemed, at times, to shock the other members of the cabinet. One night Paine suggested that I prepare a lecture on “The Age of Reason,” and deliver it from the pulpit of a church which I formerly attended. Many around the table laughed heartily at the suggestion. Not Napoleon! He drew his mouth down at the corners and groaned so loudly that all turned and looked at him with amazement. To him the church was but a pawn of the State, not to be reformed, but to be used, as a convenient inciter to mass activity by the people.</P>
<P class="p35 ft10">On one occasion Burbank was late. When he came, he was excited with enthusi- asm, and explained that he had been late, because of an experiment he was mak- ing, through which he hoped to be able to grow apples on any sort of tree. Paine chided him by reminding him that it was an apple which started all the trouble between man and woman. Darwin chuckled heartily as he suggested that Paine should watch out for little serpents, when he went into the forest to gather apples, as they had the habit of growing into big snakes. Emerson <NOBR>observed-”No</NOBR> serpents, no apples,” and Napoleon remarked, “No apples, no state!”</P>
<P class="p35 ft10">Lincoln developed the habit of always being the last one to leave the table after each meeting. On one occasion, he leaned across the end of the table, his arms folded, and remained in that position for many minutes. I made no attempt to disturb him. Finally, he lifted his head slowly, got up and walked to the door, then turned around, came back, and laid his hand on my shoulder and said, “My boy, you will need much courage if you remain steadfast in carrying out your purpose in life. But remember, when difﬁculties overtake you, the common people have common sense. Adversity will develop it.”</P>
<P class="p16 ft10">One evening Edison arrived ahead of all the others. He walked over and seated himself at my left, where Emerson was accustomed to sit, and said, “You are des- tined to witness the discovery of the secret of life. When the time comes, you will observe that life consists of great swarms of energy, or entities, each as intelligent</P>

<P class="p34 ft10">as human beings think themselves to be. These units of life group together like hives of bees, and remain together until they disintegrate, through lack of har- mony.</P>
<P class="p17 ft10">These units have differences of opinion, the same as human beings, and often ﬁght among themselves. These meetings which you are conducting will be very helpful to you. They will bring to your rescue some of the same units of life which served the members of your Cabinet, during their lives. These units are eternal. THEY NEVER DIE! Your own thoughts and DESIRES serve as the magnet which attracts units of life, from the great ocean of life out there. Only the friendly units are <NOBR>attracted-the</NOBR> ones which harmonize with the nature of your DESIRES.”</P>
<P class="p17 ft10">The other members of the Cabinet began to enter the room. Edison got up, and slowly walked around to his own seat. Edison was still living when this happened. It impressed me so greatly that I went to see him, and told him about the experi- ence. He smiled broadly, and said, “Your dream was more a reality than you may imagine it to have been.” He added no further explanation to his statement.</P>
<P class="p44 ft10">These meetings became so realistic that I became fearful of their consequences, and discontinued them for several months. The experiences were so uncanny, I was afraid if I continued them I would lose sight of the fact that the meetings were purely experiences of my imagination.</P>
<P class="p44 ft10">Some six months after I had discontinued the practice I was awakened one night, or thought I was, when I saw Lincoln standing at my bedside. He said, “The world will soon need your services. It is about to undergo a period of chaos which will cause men and women to lose faith, and become panic stricken. Go ahead with your work and complete your philosophy. That is your mission in life. If you ne- glect it, for any cause whatsoever, you will be reduced to a primal state, and be compelled to retrace the cycles through which you have passed during thousands of years.”</P>
<P class="p35 ft10">I was unable to tell, the following morning, whether I had dreamed this, or had actually been awake, and I have never since found out which it was, but I do know that the dream, if it were a dream, was so vivid in my mind the next day that I resumed my meetings the following night.</P>
<P class="p44 ft10">At our next meeting, the members of my Cabinet all ﬁled into the room together, and stood at their accustomed places at the Council Table, while Lincoln raised a glass and said, “Gentlemen, let us drink a toast to a friend who has returned to the fold.”</P>

<P class="p34 ft10">After that, I began to add new members to my Cabinet, until now it consists of more than ﬁfty, among them Christ, St. Paul, Galileo, Copernicus, Aristotle, Pla- to, Socrates, Homer, Voltaire, Bruno, Spinoza, Drummond, Kant, Schopenhau- er, Newton, Confucius, Elbert Hubbard, Brann, Ingersol, Wilson, and William James.</P>
<P class="p44 ft10">This is the ﬁrst time that I have had the courage to mention this. Heretofore, I have remained quiet on the subject, because I knew, from my own attitude in connection with such matters, that I would be misunderstood if I described my unusual experience. I have been emboldened now to reduce my experience to the printed page, because I am now less concerned about what “they say” than I was in the years that have passed. One of the blessings of maturity is that it sometimes brings one greater courage to be truthful, regardless of what those who do not understand, may think or say.</P>
<P class="p35 ft10">Lest I be misunderstood, I wish here to state most emphatically, that I still regard my Cabinet meetings as being purely imaginary, but I feel entitled to suggest that, while the members of my Cabinet may be purely ﬁctional, and the meetings exist- ent only in my own imagination, they have led me into glorious paths of adven- ture, rekindled an appreciation of true greatness, encouraged creative endeavor, and emboldened the expression of honest thought.</P>
<P class="p35 ft10">Somewhere in the <NOBR>cell-structure</NOBR> of the brain, is located an organ which receives vibrations of thought ordinarily called “hunches.” So far, science has not discov- ered where this organ of the sixth sense is located, but this is not important. The fact remains that human beings do receive accurate knowledge, through sources other than the physical senses. Such knowledge, generally, is received when the mind is under the inﬂuence of extraordinary stimulation. Any emergency which arouses the emotions, and causes the heart to beat more rapidly than normal may, and generally does, bring the sixth sense into action. Anyone who has ex- perienced a near accident while driving, knows that on such occasions, the sixth sense often comes to one’s rescue, and aids, by split seconds, in avoiding the ac- cident.</P>
<P class="p23 ft11">These facts are mentioned preliminary to a statement of fact which I shall now make, namely, that during my meetings with the “Invisible Counselors” I ﬁnd my mind most receptive to ideas, thoughts, and knowledge which reach me through the sixth sense. I can truthfully say that I owe entirely to my “Invisible Counselors” full credit for such ideas, facts, or knowledge as I received through “inspiration.”</P>
<P class="p44 ft10">On scores of occasions, when I have faced emergencies, some of them so grave that my life was in jeopardy, I have been miraculously guided past these difﬁcul- ties through the inﬂuence of my “Invisible Counselors.”</P>

<P class="p34 ft10">My original purpose in conducting Council meetings with imaginary beings, was solely that of impressing my own subconscious mind, through the principle of <NOBR>auto-suggestion,</NOBR> with certain characteristics which I desired to acquire. In more recent years, my experimentation has taken on an entirely different trend.</P>
<P class="p36 ft10">I now go to my imaginary counselors with every difﬁcult problem which confronts me and my clients. The results are often astonishing, although I do not depend entirely on this form of Counsel.</P>
<P class="p44 ft10">You, of course, have recognized that this chapter covers a subject with which a majority of people are not familiar. The Sixth Sense is a subject that will be of great interest and beneﬁt to the person whose aim is to accumulate vast wealth, but it need not claim the attention of those whose desires are more modest.</P>
<P class="p36 ft10">Henry Ford, undoubtedly understands and makes practical use of the sixth sense. His vast business and ﬁnancial operations make it necessary for him to under- stand and use this principle. The late Thomas A. Edison understood and used the sixth sense in connection with the development of inventions, especially those involving basic patents, in connection with which he had no human experience and no accumulated knowledge to guide him, as was the case while he was work- ing on the talking machine, and the moving picture machine.</P>
<P class="p35 ft10">Nearly all great leaders, such as Napoleon, Bismark, Joan of Arc, Christ, Bud- dha, Confucius, and Mohammed, understood, and probably made use of the sixth sense almost continuously. The major portion of their greatness consisted of their knowledge of this principle.</P>
<P class="p17 ft10">The sixth sense is not something that one can take off and put on at will. Ability to use this great power comes slowly, through application of the other principles outlined in this book. Seldom does any individual come into workable knowledge of the sixth sense before the age of forty. More often the knowledge is not avail- able until one is well past ﬁfty, and this, for the reason that the spiritual forces, with which the sixth sense is so closely related, do not mature and become usable except through years of meditation, <NOBR>self-examination,</NOBR> and serious thought.</P>
<P class="p44 ft10">No matter who you are, or what may have been your purpose in reading this book, you can proﬁt by it without understanding the principle described in this chapter. This is especially true if your major purpose is that of accumulation of money or other material things.</P>

<P class="p19 ft10">The chapter on the sixth sense was included, because the book is designed for the purpose of presenting a complete philosophy by which individuals may unerr- ingly guide themselves in attaining whatever they ask of life. The starting point of all achievement is DESIRE. The ﬁnishing point is that brand of KNOWLEDGE which leads to <NOBR>understanding-understanding</NOBR> of self, understanding of others, understanding of the laws of Nature, recognition and understanding of HAPPI- NESS.</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">This sort of understanding comes in its fullness only through familiarity with, and use of the principle of the sixth sense, hence that principle had to be included as a part of this philosophy, for the beneﬁt of those who demand more than money.</P>
<P class="p12 ft10">Having read the chapter, you must have observed that while reading it, you were lifted to a high level of mental stimulation. Splendid! Come back to this again a month from now, read it once more, and observe that your mind will soar to a still higher level of stimulation. Repeat this experience from time to time, giving no concern as to how much or how little you learn at the time, and eventually you will ﬁnd yourself in possession of a power that will enable you to throw off discouragement, master fear, overcome procrastination, and draw freely upon your imagination. Then you will have felt the touch of that unknown “something” which has been the moving spirit of every truly great thinker leader, artist, musi- cian, writer, statesman. Then you will be in position to transmute your DESIRES into their physical or ﬁnancial counterpart as easily as you may lie down and quit at the ﬁrst sign of opposition.</P>
<P class="p234 ft16">FAITH VS. FEAR!</P>
<P class="p97 ft10">Previous chapters have described how to develop FAITH, through <NOBR>Auto-sugges-</NOBR> tion, Desire and the Subconscious. The next chapter presents detailed instruc- tions for the mastery of FEAR.</P>
<P class="p12 ft10">Here will be found a full description of the six fears which are the cause of all dis- couragement, timidity, procrastination, indifference, indecision, and the lack of ambition, <NOBR>self-reliance,</NOBR> initiative, <NOBR>self-control,</NOBR> and enthusiasm.</P>
<P class="p12 ft10">Search yourself carefully as you study these six enemies, as they may exist only in your subconscious mind, where their presence will be hard to detect.</P>
<P class="p12 ft10">Remember, too, as you analyze the “Six Ghosts of Fear,” that they are nothing but ghosts because they exist only in one’s mind.</P>

<P class="p32 ft10">Take Inventory of Yourself, As You Read This Closing Chapter, and Find Out How Many of the “Ghosts” Are Standing in Your Way BEFORE you can put any portion of this philosophy into successful use, your mind must be prepared to receive it. The preparation is not difﬁcult. It begins with study, analysis, and understanding of three enemies which you shall have to clear out.</P>
<P class="p236 ft16">These are INDECISION, DOUBT, and FEAR!</P>
<P class="p33 ft10">The Sixth Sense will never function while these three negatives, or any of them remain in your mind. The members of this unholy trio are closely related; where one is found, the other two are close at hand.</P>
<P class="p12 ft13">INDECISION is the seedling of FEAR! Remember this, as you read. Indecision crystalizes into DOUBT, the two blend and become FEAR! The “blending” proc- ess often is slow. This is one reason why these three enemies are so dangerous. They germinate and grow without their presence being observed.</P>
<P class="p237 ft11">The remainder of this chapter describes an end which must be attained before the philosophy, as a whole, can be put into practical use. It also analyzes a condition which has, but lately, reduced huge numbers of people to poverty, and it states a truth which must be understood by all who accumulate riches, whether measured in terms of money or a state of mind of far greater value than money. The purpose of this chapter is to turn the spotlight of attention upon the cause and the cure of the six basic fears. Before we can master an enemy, we must know its name, its habits, and its place of abode. As you read, analyze yourself carefully, and deter- mine which, if any, of the six common fears have attached themselves to you.</P>
<P class="p20 ft10">Do not be deceived by the habits of these subtle enemies. Sometimes they remain hidden in the subconscious mind, where they are difﬁcult to locate, and still more difﬁcult to eliminate.</P>

<P class="p27 ft8">The fear of OLD AGE</P>
<P class="p215 ft8">The fear of DEATH</P>
<P class="p76 ft10">All other fears are of minor importance, they can be grouped under these six headings.</P>
<P class="p12 ft10">The prevalence of these fears, as a curse to the world, runs in cycles. For almost six years, while the depression was on, we ﬂoundered in the cycle of FEAR OF POVERTY. During the <NOBR>world-war,</NOBR> we were in the cycle of FEAR OF DEATH. Just following the war, we were in the cycle of FEAR OF ILL HEALTH, as evidenced by the epidemic of disease which spread itself all over the world.</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">Fears are nothing more than states of mind. One’s state of mind is subject to control and direction. Physicians, as everyone knows, are less subject to attack by disease than ordinary laymen, for the reason that physicians DO NOT FEAR DISEASE. Physicians, without fear or hesitation, have been known to physically contact hundreds of people, daily, who were suffering from such contagious dis- eases as <NOBR>small-pox,</NOBR> without becoming infected. Their immunity against the dis- ease consisted, largely, if not solely, in their absolute lack of FEAR.</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">Man can create nothing which he does not ﬁrst conceive in the form of an impulse of thought. Following this statement, comes another of still greater importance, namely, MAN’S THOUGHT IMPULSES BEGIN IMMEDIATELY TO TRANS-</P>
<P class="p68 ft10">LATE THEMSELVES INTO THEIR PHYSICAL EQUIVALENT, WHETHER THOSE THOUGHTS ARE VOLUNTARY OR INVOLUNTARY. Thought impulses which are picked up through the ether, by mere chance (thoughts which have been released by other minds) may determine one’s ﬁnancial, business, profes- sional, or social destiny just as surely as do the thought impulses which one cre- ates by intent and design.</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">We are here laying the foundation for the presentation of a fact of great impor- tance to the person who does not understand why some people appear to be “lucky” while others of equal or greater ability, training, experience, and brain capacity, seem destined to ride with misfortune. This fact may be explained by the statement that every human being has the ability to completely control his own mind, and with this control, obviously, every person may open his mind to</P>

<P class="p19 ft10">the tramp thought impulses which are being released by other brains, or close the doors tightly and admit only thought impulses of his own choice.</P>
<P class="p12 ft10">Nature has endowed man with absolute control over but one thing, and that is THOUGHT. This fact, coupled with the additional fact that everything which man creates, begins in the form of a thought, leads one very near to the principle by which FEAR may be mastered.</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">If it is true that ALL THOUGHT HAS A TENDENCY TO CLOTHE ITSELF IN ITS PHYSICAL EQUIVALENT (and this is true, beyond any reasonable room for doubt), it is equally true that thought impulses of fear and poverty cannot be translated into terms of courage and ﬁnancial gain.</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">The people of America began to think of poverty, following the Wall Street crash of 1929. Slowly, but surely that mass thought was crystalized into its physical equivalent, which was known as a “depression.” This had to happen, it is in con- formity with the laws of Nature.</P>
<P class="p75 ft16">THE FEAR OF POVERTY</P>
<P class="p119 ft10">There can be no compromise between POVERTY and RICHES! The two roads that lead to poverty and riches travel in opposite directions. If you want riches, you must refuse to accept any circumstance that leads toward poverty. (The word “riches” is here used in its broadest sense, meaning ﬁnancial, spiritual, mental and material estates). The starting point of the path that leads to riches is DESIRE. In chapter one, you received full instructions for the proper use of DESIRE. In this chapter, on FEAR, you have complete instructions for preparing your mind to make practical use of DESIRE.</P>
<P class="p38 ft11">Here, then, is the place to give yourself a challenge which will deﬁnitely determine how much of this philosophy you have absorbed. Here is the point at which you can turn prophet and foretell, accurately, what the future holds in store for you. If, after reading this chapter, you are willing to accept poverty, you may as well make up your mind to receive poverty. This is one decision you cannot avoid.</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">If you demand riches, determine what form, and how much will be required to satisfy you. You know the road that leads to riches. You have been given a road map which, if followed, will keep you on that road. If you neglect to make the start, or stop before you arrive, no one will be to blame, but YOU. This responsi- bility is yours. No alibi will save you from accepting the responsibility if you now fail or refuse to demand riches of Life, because the acceptance calls for but one</P>

<P class="p15 ft10"><NOBR>thing-incidentally,</NOBR> the only thing you can <NOBR>control-and</NOBR> that is a STATE OF MIND. A state of mind is something that one assumes. It cannot be purchased, it must be created.</P>
<P class="p17 ft10">Fear of poverty is a state of mind, nothing else! But it is sufﬁcient to destroy one’s chances of achievement in any undertaking, a truth which became painfully evi- dent during the depression.</P>
<P class="p18 ft10">This fear paralyzes the faculty of reason, destroys the faculty of imagination, kills off <NOBR>self-reliance,</NOBR> undermines enthusiasm, discourages initiative, leads to uncer- tainty of purpose, encourages procrastination, wipes out enthusiasm and makes <NOBR>self-control</NOBR> an impossibility. It takes the charm from one’s personality, destroys the possibility of accurate thinking, diverts concentration of effort, it masters per- sistence, turns the <NOBR>will-power</NOBR> into nothingness, destroys ambition, beclouds the memory and invites failure in every conceivable form; it kills love and assassi- nates the ﬁner emotions of the heart, discourages friendship and invites disaster in a hundred forms, leads to sleeplessness, misery and <NOBR>unhappiness-and</NOBR> all this despite the obvious truth that we live in a world of <NOBR>over-abundance</NOBR> of everything the heart could desire, with nothing standing between us and our desires, except- ing lack of a deﬁnite purpose.</P>
<P class="p23 ft10">The Fear of Poverty is, without doubt, the most destructive of the six basic fears. It has been placed at the head of the list, because it is the most difﬁcult to mas- ter. Considerable courage is required to state the truth about the origin of this fear, and still greater courage to accept the truth after it has been stated. The fear of poverty grew out of man’s inherited tendency to PREY UPON HIS FEL- LOW MAN ECONOMICALLY. Nearly all animals lower than man are motivated by instinct, but their capacity to “think” is limited, therefore, they prey upon one another physically. Man, with his superior sense of intuition, with the capacity to think and to reason, does not eat his fellowman bodily, he gets more satisfaction out of “eating” him FINANCIALLY. Man is so avaricious that every conceivable law has been passed to safeguard him from his fellowman.</P>
<P class="p23 ft10">Of all the ages of the world, of which we know anything, the age in which we live seems to be one that is outstanding because of man’s <NOBR>money-madness.</NOBR> A man is considered less than the dust of the earth, unless he can display a fat bank ac- count; but if he has <NOBR>money-NEVER</NOBR> MIND HOW HE ACQUIRED <NOBR>IT-he</NOBR> is a “king” or a “big shot”; he is above the law, he rules in politics, he dominates in business, and the whole world about him bows in respect when he passes.</P>
<P class="p16 ft12">Nothing brings man so much suffering and humility as POVERTY! Only those who have experienced poverty understand the full meaning of this.</P>

<P class="p19 ft10">It is no wonder that man fears poverty. Through a long line of inherited experi- ences man has learned, for sure, that some men cannot be trusted, where matters of money and earthly possessions are concerned. This is a rather stinging indict- ment, the worst part of it being that it is TRUE.</P>
<P class="p12 ft10">The majority of marriages are motivated by the wealth possessed by one, or both of the contracting parties. It is no wonder, therefore, that the divorce courts are busy.</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">So eager is man to possess wealth that he will acquire it in whatever manner he <NOBR>can-through</NOBR> legal methods if <NOBR>possible-through</NOBR> other methods if necessary or ex- pedient.</P>
<P class="p12 ft10"><NOBR>Self-analysis</NOBR> may disclose weaknesses which one does not like to acknowledge. This form of examination is essential to all who demand of Life more than me- diocrity and poverty. Remember, as you check yourself point by point, that you are both the court and the jury, the prosecuting attorney and the attorney for the defense, and that you are the plaintiff and the defendant, also, that you are on trial. Face the facts squarely. Ask yourself deﬁnite questions and demand direct replies. When the examination is over, you will know more about yourself. If you do not feel that you can be an impartial judge in this <NOBR>self-examination,</NOBR> call upon someone who knows you well to serve as judge while you <NOBR>cross-examine</NOBR> yourself. You are after the truth. Get it, no matter at what cost even though it may tempo- rarily embarrass you!</P>
<P class="p33 ft10">The majority of people, if asked what they fear most, would reply, “I fear noth- ing.” The reply would be inaccurate, because few people realize that they are bound, handicapped, whipped spiritually and physically through some form of fear. So subtle and deeply seated is the emotion of fear that one may go through life burdened with it, never recognizing its presence. Only a courageous analysis will disclose the presence of this universal enemy. When you begin such an analy- sis, search deeply into your character. Here is a list of the symptoms for which you should look:</P>
<P class="p118 ft16">SYMPTOMS OF THE FEAR OF POVERTY</P>
<P class="p33 ft10">INDIFFERENCE. Commonly expressed through lack of ambition; willingness to tolerate poverty; acceptance of whatever compensation life may offer without protest; mental and physical laziness; lack of initiative, imagination, enthusiasm and <NOBR>self-control</NOBR></P>

<P class="p121 ft12">INDECISION. The habit of permitting others to do one’s thinking. Staying “on the fence.”</P>
<P class="p240 ft10">DOUBT. Generally expressed through alibis and excuses designed to cover up, explain away, or apologize for one’s failures, sometimes expressed in the form of envy of those who are successful, or by criticising them.</P>
<P class="p185 ft10">WORRY. Usually expressed by ﬁnding fault with others, a tendency to spend beyond one’s income, neglect of personal appearance, scowling and frowning; in- temperance in the use of alcoholic drink, sometimes through the use of narcotics; nervousness, lack of poise, <NOBR>self-consciousness</NOBR> and lack of <NOBR>self-reliance.</NOBR></P>
<P class="p241 ft10"><NOBR>OVER-CAUTION.</NOBR> The habit of looking for the negative side of every circum- stance, thinking and talking of possible failure instead of concentrating upon the means of succeeding. Knowing all the roads to disaster, but never searching for the plans to avoid failure. Waiting for “the right time” to begin putting ideas and plans into action, until the waiting becomes a permanent habit. Remembering those who have failed, and forgetting those who have succeeded. Seeing the hole in the doughnut, but overlooking the doughnut. Pessimism, leading to indiges- tion, poor elimination, <NOBR>auto-intoxication,</NOBR> bad breath and bad disposition.</P>
<P class="p242 ft10">PROCRASTINATION. The habit of putting off until tomorrow that which should have been done last year. Spending enough time in creating alibis and excuses to have done the job. This symptom is closely related to <NOBR>over-caution,</NOBR> doubt and worry. Refusal to accept responsibility when it can be avoided. Willingness to compromise rather than put up a stiff ﬁght. Compromising with difﬁculties in- stead of harnessing and using them as stepping stones to advancement. Bargain- ing with Life for a penny, instead of demanding prosperity, opulence, riches, con- tentment and happiness. Planning what to do IF AND WHEN OVERTAKEN BY FAILURE, INSTEAD OF BURNING ALL BRIDGES AND MAKING RETREAT IMPOSSIBLE. Weakness of, and often total lack of <NOBR>self-conﬁdence,</NOBR> deﬁniteness of purpose, <NOBR>self-control,</NOBR> initiative, enthusiasm, ambition, thrift and sound rea- soning ability.</P>
<P class="p23 ft10">EXPECTING POVERTY INSTEAD OF DEMANDING RICHES. Association with those who accept poverty instead of seeking the company of those who demand and receive riches.</P>

<P class="p8 ft16">MONEY TALKS!</P>
<P class="p97 ft10">Some will ask, “why did you write a book about money? Why measure riches in dollars, alone?” Some will believe, and rightly so, that there are other forms of riches more desirable than money.</P>
<P class="p12 ft10">Yes, there are riches which cannot be measured in terms of dollars, but there are millions of people who will say, “Give me all the money I need, and I will ﬁnd everything else I want.”</P>
<P class="p14 ft11">The major reason why I wrote this book on how to get money is the fact that the world has but lately passed through an experience that left millions of men and women paralyzed with the FEAR OF POVERTY. What this sort of fear does to one was well described by Westbrook Pegler, in the New York <NOBR>World-Telegram,</NOBR> viz:</P>
<P class="p12 ft10">“Money is only clam shells or metal discs or scraps of paper, and there are treas- ures of the heart and soul which money cannot buy, but most people, being broke, are unable to keep this in mind and sustain their spirits. When a man is down and out and on the street, unable to get any job at all, something happens to his spirit which can be observed in the droop of his shoulders, the set of his hat, his walk and his gaze. He cannot escape a feeling of inferiority among people with regular employment, even though he knows they are deﬁnitely not his equals in charac- ter, intelligence or ability.</P>
<P class="p20 ft10">“These <NOBR>people-even</NOBR> his <NOBR>friends-feel,</NOBR> on the other hand, a sense of superiority and regard him, perhaps unconsciously, as a casualty. He may borrow for a time, but not enough to carry on in his accustomed way, and he cannot continue to borrow very long.</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">But borrowing in itself, when a man is borrowing merely to live, is a depressing experience, and the money lacks the power of earned money to revive his spirits. Of course, none of this applies to bums or habitual <NOBR>ne’er-do-wells,</NOBR> but only to men of normal ambitions and <NOBR>self-respect.</NOBR></P>
<P class="p75 ft16">“WOMEN CONCEAL DESPAIR.</P>
<P class="p22 ft10">“Women in the same predicament must be different. We somehow do not think of women at all in considering the <NOBR>down-and-outers.</NOBR> They are scarce in the bread- lines, they rarely are seen begging on the streets, and they are not recognizable in crowds by the same plain signs which identify busted men. Of course, I do not mean the shufﬂing hags of the city streets who are the opposite number of the</P>

<P class="p19 ft10">conﬁrmed male bums. I mean reasonably young, decent and intelligent women. There must be many of them, but their despair is not apparent. Maybe they kill themselves.</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">“When a man is down and out he has time on his hands for brooding. He may travel miles to see a man about a job and discover that the job is ﬁlled or that it is one of those jobs with no base pay but only a commission on the sale of some useless <NOBR>knick-knack</NOBR> which nobody would buy, except out of pity. Turning that down, he ﬁnds himself back on the street with nowhere to go but just anywhere. So he walks and walks. He gazes into store windows at luxuries which are not for him, and feels inferior and gives way to people who stop to look with an active interest. He wanders into the railroad station or puts himself down in the library to ease his legs and soak up a little heat, but that isn’t looking for a job, so he gets going again. He may not know it, but his aimlessness would give him away even if the very lines of his ﬁgure did not. He may be well dressed in the clothes left over from the days when he had a steady job, but the clothes cannot disguise the droop.</P>
<P class="p96 ft16">“MONEY MAKES DIFFERENCE.</P>
<P class="p33 ft10">“He sees thousands of other people, bookkeepers or clerks or chemists or wagon hands, busy at their work and envies them from the bottom of his soul. They have their independence, their <NOBR>self-respect</NOBR> and manhood, and he simply cannot con- vince himself that he is a good man, too, though he argue it out and arrive at a favorable verdict hour after hour.</P>
<P class="p13 ft12">“It is just money which makes this difference in him. With a little money he would be himself again.</P>
<P class="p20 ft10">“Some employers take the most shocking advantage of people who are down and out. The agencies hang out little colored cards offering miserable wages to busted <NOBR>men-$12</NOBR> a week, $15 a week.</P>
<P class="p12 ft10">An $18 a week job is a plum, and anyone with $25 a week to offer does not hang the job in front of an agency on a colored card. I have a want ad clipped from a local paper demanding a clerk, a good, clean penman, to take telephone orders for a sandwich shop from 11 A.M. to 2 P.M. for $8 a <NOBR>month-not</NOBR> $8 a week but $8 a month.</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">The ad says also, `State religion.’ Can you imagine the brutal effrontery of anyone who demands a good, clean penman for 11 cents an hour inquiring into the vic- tim’s religion? But that is what busted people are offered.”</P>

<P class="p8 ft16">THE FEAR OF CRITICISM</P>
<P class="p58 ft10">Just how man originally came by this fear, no one can state deﬁnitely, but one thing is certain- he has it in a highly developed form. Some believe that this fear made its appearance about the time that politics became a “profession.” Others believe it can be traced to the age when women ﬁrst began to concern themselves with “styles” in wearing apparel.</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">This author, being neither a humorist nor a prophet, is inclined to attribute the basic fear of criticism to that part of man’s inherited nature which prompts him not only to take away his fellowman’s goods and wares, but to justify his action by CRITICISM of his fellowman’s character. It is a well known fact that a thief will criticise the man from whom he <NOBR>steals-that</NOBR> politicians seek ofﬁce, not by dis- playing their own virtues and qualiﬁcations, but by attempting to besmirch their opponents.</P>
<P class="p20 ft10">The fear of criticism takes on many forms, the majority of which are petty and trivial. <NOBR>Bald-headed</NOBR> men, for example, are bald for no other reason than their fear of criticism. Heads become bald because of the tight ﬁtting bands of hats which cut off the circulation from the roots of the hair. Men wear hats, not because they actually need them, but mainly because “everyone is doing it.”</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">The individual falls into line and does likewise, lest some other individual CRITI- CISE him. Women seldom have bald heads, or even thin hair, because they wear hats which ﬁt their heads loosely, the only purpose of the hats being adornment.</P>
<P class="p12 ft10">But, it must not be supposed that women are free from the fear of criticism. If any woman claims to be superior to man with reference to this fear, ask her to walk down the street wearing a hat of the vintage of 1890.</P>
<P class="p12 ft10">The astute manufacturers of clothing have not been slow to capitalize this basic fear of criticism, with which all mankind has been cursed. Every season the styles in many articles of wearing apparel change. Who establishes the styles? Certainly not the purchaser of clothing, but the manufacturer. Why does he change the styles so often? The answer is obvious. He changes the styles so he can sell more clothes.</P>
<P class="p38 ft10">For the same reason the manufacturers of automobiles (with a few rare and very sensible exceptions) change styles of models every season. No man wants to drive an automobile which is not of the latest style, although the older model may ac- tually be the better car. We have been describing the manner in which people behave under the inﬂuence of fear of criticism as applied to the small and petty</P>

<P class="p39 ft11">things of life. Let us now examine human behavior when this fear affects people in connection with the more important events of human relationship. Take for example practically any person who has reached the age of “mental maturity” (from 35 to 40 years of age, as a general average), and if you could read the secret thoughts of his mind, you would ﬁnd a very decided disbelief in most of the fables taught by the majority of the dogmatists and theologians a few decades back.</P>
<P class="p20 ft10">Not often, however, will you ﬁnd a person who has the courage to openly state his belief on this subject. Most people will, if pressed far enough, tell a lie rather than admit that they do not believe the stories associated with that form of religion which held people in bondage prior to the age of scientiﬁc discovery and educa- tion.</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">Why does the average person, even in this day of enlightenment, shy away from denying his belief in the fables which were the basis of most of the religions a few decades ago? The answer is, “because of the fear of criticism.” Men and women have been burned at the stake for daring to express disbelief in ghosts. It is no wonder we have inherited a consciousness which makes us fear criticism. The time was, and not so far in the past, when criticism carried severe <NOBR>punishments-it</NOBR> still does in some countries.</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">The fear of criticism robs man of his initiative, destroys his power of imagination, limits his individuality, takes away his <NOBR>self-reliance,</NOBR> and does him damage in a hundred other ways. Parents often do their children irreparable injury by criti- cising them. The mother of one of my boyhood chums used to punish him with a switch almost daily, always completing the job with the statement, “You’ll land in the penitentiary before you are twenty.” He was sent to a Reformatory at the age of seventeen. Criticism is the one form of service, of which everyone has too much. Everyone has a stock of it which is handed out, gratis, whether called for or not. One’s nearest relatives often are the worst offenders. It should be recognized as a crime (in reality it is a crime of the worst nature), for any parent to build infe- riority complexes in the mind of a child, through unnecessary criticism. Employ- ers who understand human nature, get the best there is in men, not by criticism, but by constructive suggestion. Parents may accomplish the same results with their children. Criticism will plant FEAR in the human heart, or resentment, but it will not build love or affection.</P>
<P class="p243 ft16">SYMPTOMS OF THE FEAR OF CRITICISM</P>
<P class="p20 ft10">This fear is almost as universal as the fear of poverty, and its effects are just as fatal to personal achievement, mainly because this fear destroys initiative, and discourages the use of imagination.</P>

<P class="p20 ft10"><NOBR>SELF-CONSCIOUSNESS.</NOBR> Generally expressed through nervousness, timidity in conversation and in meeting strangers, awkward movement of the hands and limbs, shifting of the eyes.</P>
<P class="p13 ft12">LACK OF POISE. Expressed through lack of voice control, nervousness in the presence of others, poor posture of body, poor memory.</P>
<P class="p20 ft10">PERSONALITY. Lacking in ﬁrmness of decision, personal charm, and ability to express opinions deﬁnitely. The habit of <NOBR>side-stepping</NOBR> issues instead of meeting them squarely. Agreeing with others without careful examination of their opin- ions.</P>
<P class="p12 ft10">INFERIORITY COMPLEX. The habit of expressing <NOBR>self-approval</NOBR> by word of mouth and by actions, as a means of covering up a feeling of inferiority. Using “big words” to impress others, (often without knowing the real meaning of the words). Imitating others in dress, speech and manners. Boasting of imaginary achievements.

<P class="p20 ft12">EXTRAVAGANCE. The habit of trying to “keep up with the Joneses,” spending beyond one’s income.</P>
<P class="p20 ft10">LACK OF INITIATIVE. Failure to embrace opportunities for <NOBR>self-advancement,</NOBR> fear to express opinions, lack of conﬁdence in one’s own ideas, giving evasive an- swers to questions asked by superiors, hesitancy of manner and speech, deceit in both words and deeds.</P>
<P class="p12 ft10">LACK OF AMBITION. Mental and physical laziness, lack of <NOBR>self-assertion,</NOBR> slow- ness in reaching decisions, easily inﬂuenced by others, the habit of criticising oth- ers behind their backs and ﬂattering them to their faces, the habit of accepting defeat without protest, quitting an undertaking when opposed by others, suspi- cious of other people without cause, lacking in tactfulness of manner and speech, unwillingness to accept the blame for mistakes.</P>

<P class="p8 ft16">THE FEAR OF ILL HEALTH</P>
<P class="p33 ft10">This fear may be traced to both physical and social heredity. It is closely associ- ated, as to its origin, with the causes of fear of Old Age and the fear of Death, because it leads one closely to the border of “terrible worlds” of which man knows not, but concerning which he has been taught some discomforting stories. The opinion is somewhat general, also, that certain unethical people engaged in the business of “selling health” have had not a little to do with keeping alive the fear of ill health.</P>
<P class="p20 ft10">In the main, man fears ill health because of the terrible pictures which have been planted in his mind of what may happen if death should overtake him. He also fears it because of the economic toll which it may claim.</P>
<P class="p12 ft10">A reputable physician estimated that 75% of all people who visit physicians for professional service are suffering with hypochondria (imaginary illness). It has been shown most convincingly that the fear of disease, even where there is not the slightest cause for fear, often produces the physical symptoms of the disease feared.</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">Powerful and mighty is the human mind! It builds or it destroys. Playing upon this common weakness of fear of ill health, dispensers of patent medicines have reaped fortunes. This form of imposition upon credulous humanity became so prevalent some twenty years ago that Colliers’ Weekly Magazine conducted a bit- ter campaign against some of the worst offenders in the patent medicine busi- ness.</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">During the “ﬂu” epidemic which broke out during the world war, the mayor of New York City took drastic steps to check the damage which people were doing themselves through their inherent fear of ill health. He called in the newspaper men and said to them, “Gentlemen, I feel it necessary to ask you not to publish any scare headlines concerning the `ﬂu’ epidemic. Unless you cooperate with me, we will have a situation which we cannot control.” The newspapers quit publish- ing stories about the “ﬂu,” and within one month the epidemic had been success- fully checked.</P>
<P class="p20 ft10">Through a series of experiments conducted some years ago, it was proved that people may be made ill by suggestion. We conducted this experiment by caus- ing three acquaintances to visit the “victims,” each of whom asked the question, “What ails you?</P>
<P class="p13 ft12">You look terribly ill.” The ﬁrst questioner usually provoked a grin, and a noncha- lant “Oh, nothing, I’m alright,” from the victim. The second questioner usually</P>

<P class="p19 ft10">was answered with the statement, “I don’t know exactly, but I do feel badly.” The third questioner was usually met with the frank admission that the victim was actually feeling ill.</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">Try this on an acquaintance if you doubt that it will make him uncomfortable, but do not carry the experiment too far. There is a certain religious sect whose members take vengeance upon their enemies by the “hexing” method. They call it “placing a spell” on the victim.</P>
<P class="p12 ft10">There is overwhelming evidence that disease sometimes begins in the form of negative thought impulse. Such an impulse may be passed from one mind to an- other, by suggestion, or created by an individual in his own mind.</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">A man who was blessed with more wisdom than this incident might indicate, once said “When anyone asks me how I feel, I always want to answer by knocking him down.”</P>
<P class="p12 ft10">Doctors send patients into new climates for their health, because a change of “mental attitude” is necessary. The seed of fear of ill health lives in every human mind. Worry, fear, discouragement, disappointment in love and business affairs, cause this seed to germinate and grow. The recent business depression kept the doctors on the run, because every form of negative thinking may cause ill health.</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">Disappointments in business and in love stand at the head of the list of causes of fear of ill health. A young man suffered a disappointment in love which sent him to a hospital. For months he hovered between life and death. A specialist in suggestive therapeutics was called in. The specialist changed nurses, placing him in charge of a very charming young woman who began (by <NOBR>pre-arrangement</NOBR> with the doctor) to make love to him the ﬁrst day of her arrival on the job. Within three weeks the patient was discharged from the hospital, still suffering, but with an entirely different malady. HE WAS IN LOVE AGAIN. The remedy was a hoax, but the patient and the nurse were later married. Both are in good health at the time of this writing.</P>
<P class="p96 ft16">SYMPTOMS OF THE FEAR OF ILL HEALTH</P>
<P class="p21 ft8">The symptoms of this almost universal fear are:</P>
<P class="p33 ft10"><NOBR>AUTO-SUGGESTION.</NOBR> The habit of negative use of <NOBR>self-suggestion</NOBR> by looking for, and expecting to ﬁnd the symptoms of all kinds of disease. “Enjoying” imaginary illness and speaking of it as being real. The habit of trying all “fads” and “isms” recommended by others as having therapeutic value. Talking to others of opera- tions, accidents and other forms of illness.</P>

<P class="p13 ft10">Hypochondria, (a medical term for imaginary disease) is said to do as much dam- age on occasion, as the disease one fears might do. Most <NOBR>so-called</NOBR> cases of “nerves” come from imaginary illness.</P>

<P class="p20 ft10">SUSCEPTIBILITY. Fear of ill health breaks down Nature’s body resistance, and creates a favorable condition for any form of disease one may contact. The fear of ill health often is related to the fear of Poverty, especially in the case of the hypo- chondriac, who constantly worries about the possibility of having to pay doctor’s bills, hospital bills, etc. This type of person spends much time preparing for sick- ness, talking about death, saving money for cemetery lots, and burial expenses, etc.</P>

<P class="p75 ft16">THE FEAR OF LOSS OF LOVE</P>
<P class="p20 ft10">The original source of this inherent fear needs but little description, because it obviously grew out of man’s polygamous habit of stealing his <NOBR>fellow-man’s</NOBR> mate, and his habit of taking liberties with her whenever he could.</P>

<P class="p19 ft10">Jealousy, and other similar forms of dementia praecox grow out of man’s inher- ited fear of the loss of love of someone. This fear is the most painful of all the six basic fears. It probably plays more havoc with the body and mind than any of the other basic fears, as it often leads to permanent insanity.</P>
<P class="p12 ft10">The fear of the loss of love probably dates back to the stone age, when men stole women by brute force. They continue to steal females, but their technique has changed. Instead of force, they now use persuasion, the promise of pretty clothes, motor cars, and other “bait” much more effective than physical force. Man’s hab- its are the same as they were at the dawn of civilization, but he expresses them differently.</P>
<P class="p20 ft10">Careful analysis has shown that women are more susceptible to this fear than men. This fact is easily explained. Women have learned, from experience, that men are polygamous by nature, that they are not to be trusted in the hands of rivals.</P>
<P class="p75 ft16">SYMPTOMS OF THE FEAR OF LOSS OF LOVE</P>
<P class="p244 ft8">The distinguishing symptoms of this fear are:-</P>
<P class="p245 ft10">JEALOUSY. The habit of being suspicious of friends and loved ones without any reasonable evidence of sufﬁcient grounds. (Jealousy is a form of dementia praecox which sometimes becomes violent without the slightest cause). The habit of accusing wife or husband of inﬁdelity without grounds. General suspicion of everyone, absolute faith in no one.</P>
<P class="p128 ft10">FAULT FINDING. The habit of ﬁnding fault with friends, relatives, business associates and loved ones upon the slightest provocation, or without any cause whatsoever.</P>
<P class="p246 ft10">GAMBLING. The habit of gambling, stealing, cheating, and otherwise taking hazardous chances to provide money for loved ones, with the belief that love can be bought. The habit of spending beyond one’s means, or incurring debts, to pro- vide gifts for loved ones, with the object of making a favorable showing. Insom- nia, nervousness, lack of persistence, weakness of will, lack of <NOBR>self-control,</NOBR> lack of <NOBR>self-reliance,</NOBR> bad temper.</P>

<P class="p8 ft16">THE FEAR OF OLD AGE</P>
<P class="p58 ft10">In the main, this fear grows out of two sources. First, the thought that old age may bring with it POVERTY. Secondly, and by far the most common source of origin, from false and cruel teachings of the past which have been too well mixed with “ﬁre and brimstone,” and other bogies cunningly designed to enslave man through fear.</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">In the basic fear of old age, man has two very sound reasons for his apprehen- <NOBR>sion-one</NOBR> growing out of his distrust of his fellowman, who may seize whatever worldly goods he may possess, and the other arising from the terrible pictures of the world beyond, which were planted in his mind, through social heredity before he came into full possession of his mind.</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">The possibility of ill health, which is more common as people grow older, is also a contributing cause of this common fear of old age. Eroticism also enters into the cause of the fear of old age, as no man cherishes the thought of diminishing sex attraction.</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">The most common cause of fear of old age is associated with the possibility of poverty. “Poorhouse” is not a pretty word. It throws a chill into the mind of every person who faces the possibility of having to spend his declining years on a poor farm.</P>
<P class="p12 ft10">Another contributing cause of the fear of old age, is the possibility of loss of free- dom and independence, as old age may bring with it the loss of both physical and economic freedom.</P>
<P class="p46 ft16">SYMPTOMS OF THE FEAR OF OLD AGE</P>
<P class="p244 ft8">The commonest symptoms of this fear are:</P>
<P class="p247 ft10">The tendency to slow down and develop an inferiority complex at the age of mental maturity, around the age of forty, falsely believing one’s self to be “slip- ping” because of age. (The truth is that man’s most useful years, mentally and spiritually, are those between forty and sixty).</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">The habit of speaking apologetically of one’s self as “being old” merely because one has reached the age of forty, or ﬁfty, instead of reversing the rule and express- ing gratitude for having reached the age of wisdom and understanding.</P>
<P class="p40 ft8">The habit of killing off initiative, imagination, and <NOBR>self-reliance</NOBR> by falsely believ-</P>

<P class="p33 ft10">The habit of the man or woman of forty dressing with the aim of trying to appear much younger, and affecting mannerisms of youth; thereby inspiring ridicule by both friends and strangers.</P>
<P class="p75 ft16">THE FEAR OF DEATH</P>
<P class="p248 ft10">To some this is the cruelest of all the basic fears. The reason is obvious. The terrible pangs of fear associated with the thought of death, in the majority of cas- es, may be charged directly to religious fanaticism. <NOBR>So-called</NOBR> “heathen” are less afraid of death than the more “civilized.” For hundreds of millions of years man has been asking the still unanswered questions, “whence” and “whither.”</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">Where did I come from, and where am I going? During the darker ages of the past, the more cunning and crafty were not slow to offer the answer to these ques- tions, FOR A PRICE. Witness, now, the major source of origin of the FEAR OF DEATH.</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">“Come into my tent, embrace my faith, accept my dogmas, and I will give you a ticket that will admit you straightaway into heaven when you die,” cries a leader of sectarianism. “Remain out of my tent,” says the same leader, “and may the devil take you and burn you throughout eternity.”</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">ETERNITY is a long time. FIRE is a terrible thing. The thought of eternal punish- ment, with ﬁre, not only causes man to fear death, it often causes him to lose his reason. It destroys interest in life and makes happiness impossible.</P>
<P class="p12 ft10">During my research, I reviewed a book entitled “A Catalogue of the Gods,” in which were listed the 30,000 gods which man has worshiped. Think of it! Thirty thousand of them, represented by everything from a crawﬁsh to a man. It is little wonder that men have become frightened at the approach of death.</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">While the religious leader may not be able to provide safe conduct into heaven, nor, by lack of such provision, allow the unfortunate to descend into hell, the pos- sibility of the latter seems so terrible that the very thought of it lays hold of the imagination in such a realistic way that it paralyzes reason, and sets up the fear of death.</P>
<P class="p13 ft12">In truth, NO MAN KNOWS, and no man has ever known, what heaven or hell is like, nor does any man know if either place actually exists. This very lack of</P>

<P class="p13 ft10">The fear of DEATH is not as common now as it was during the age when there were no great colleges and universities. Men of science have turned the spotlight of truth upon the world, and this truth is rapidly freeing men and women from this terrible fear of DEATH. The young men and young women who attend the colleges and universities are not easily impressed by “ﬁre” and “brimstone.”</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">Through the aid of biology, astronomy, geology, and other related sciences, the fears of the dark ages which gripped the minds of men and destroyed their reason have been dispelled.</P>
<P class="p12 ft12">Insane asylums are ﬁlled with men and women who have gone mad, because of the FEAR OF DEATH.</P>
<P class="p20 ft10">This fear is useless. Death will come, no matter what anyone may think about it. Accept it as a necessity, and pass the thought out of your mind. It must be a, necessity, or it would not come to all. Perhaps it is not as bad as it has been pic- tured.</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">The entire world is made up of only two things, ENERGY and MATTER. In el- ementary physics we learn that neither matter nor energy (the only two realities known to man) can be created nor destroyed. Both matter and energy can be transformed, but neither can be destroyed.</P>
<P class="p12 ft10">Life is energy, if it is anything. If neither energy nor matter can be destroyed, of course life cannot be destroyed. Life, like other forms of energy, may be passed through various processes of transition, or change, but it cannot be destroyed. Death is mere transition.</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">If death is not mere change, or transition, then nothing comes after death except a long, eternal, peaceful sleep, and sleep is nothing to be feared. Thus you may wipe out, forever, the fear of Death.</P>

<P class="p39 ft11">prevalent among the aged, but sometimes the more youthful are victims of it. The greatest of all remedies for the fear of death is a BURNING DESIRE FOR ACHIEVEMENT, backed by useful service to others. A busy person seldom has time to think about dying. He ﬁnds life too thrilling to worry about death. Some- times the fear of death is closely associated with the Fear of Poverty, where one’s death would leave loved ones <NOBR>poverty-stricken.</NOBR> In other cases, the fear of death is caused by illness and the consequent breaking down of physical body resistance. The commonest causes of the fear of death are: <NOBR>ill-health,</NOBR> poverty, lack of appro- priate occupation, disappointment over love, insanity, religious fanaticism.</P>
<P class="p41 ft16">OLD MAN WORRY</P>
<P class="p33 ft10">Worry is a state of mind based upon fear. It works slowly, but persistently. It is insiduous and subtle. Step by step it “digs itself in” until it paralyzes one’s reason- ing faculty, destroys <NOBR>self-conﬁdence</NOBR> and initiative. Worry is a form of sustained fear caused by indecision therefore it is a state of mind which can be controlled. An unsettled mind is helpless. Indecision makes an unsettled mind. Most indi- viduals lack the willpower to reach decisions promptly, and to stand by them after they have been made, even during normal business conditions. During periods of economic unrest (such as the world recently experienced), the individual is handicapped, not alone by his inherent nature to be slow at reaching decisions, but he is inﬂuenced by the indecision of others around him who have created a state of “mass indecision.”</P>
<P class="p33 ft10">During the depression the whole atmosphere, all over the world, was ﬁlled with “Fearenza” and “Worryitis,” the two mental disease germs which began to spread themselves after the Wall Street frenzy in 1929. There is only one known antidote for these germs; it is the habit of prompt and ﬁrm DECISION. Moreover, it is an antidote which every individual must apply for himself.</P>
<P class="p13 ft12">We do not worry over conditions, once we have reached a decision to follow a deﬁnite line of action.</P>
<P class="p20 ft10">I once interviewed a man who was to be electrocuted two hours later. The con- demned man was the calmest of some eight men who were in the <NOBR>death-cell</NOBR> with him. His calmness prompted me to ask him how it felt to know that he was going into eternity in a short while. With a smile of conﬁdence on his face, he said, “It feels ﬁne.</P>

<P class="p34 ft10">these things. I have felt ﬁne ever since I learned FOR CERTAIN that I must die. I made up my mind then, to accept my fate in good spirit.”</P>
<P class="p36 ft10">As he spoke he devoured a dinner of proportions sufﬁcient for three men, eating every mouthful of the food brought to him, and apparently enjoying it as much as if no disaster awaited him.</P>
<P class="p44 ft10">DECISION gave this man resignation to his fate! Decision can also prevent one’s acceptance of undesired circumstances. The six basic fears become translated into a state of worry, through indecision. Relieve yourself, forever of the fear of death, by reaching a decision to accept death as an inescapable event. Whip the fear of poverty by reaching a decision to get along with whatever wealth you can accumulate WITHOUT WORRY. Put your foot upon the neck of the fear of criti- cism by reaching a decision NOT TO WORRY about what other people think, do, or say. Eliminate the fear of old age by reaching a decision to accept it, not as a handicap, but as a great blessing which carries with it wisdom, <NOBR>self-control,</NOBR> and understanding not known to youth.</P>
<P class="p35 ft10">Acquit yourself of the fear of ill health by the decision to forget symptoms. Master the fear of loss of love by reaching a decision to get along without love, if that is necessary.</P>
<P class="p17 ft11">Kill the habit of worry, in all its forms, by reaching a general, blanket decision that nothing which life has to offer is worth the price of worry. With this decision will come poise, peace of mind, and calmness of thought which will bring happiness.</P>
<P class="p36 ft10">A man whose mind is ﬁlled with fear not only destroys his own chances of intelli- gent action, but, he transmits these destructive vibrations to the minds of all who come into contact with him, and destroys, also their chances.</P>
<P class="p36 ft10">Even a dog or a horse knows when its master lacks courage; moreover, a dog or a horse will pick up the vibrations of fear thrown off by its master, and behave ac- cordingly. Lower down the line of intelligence in the animal kingdom, one ﬁnds this same capacity to pick up the vibrations of fear. A <NOBR>honey-bee</NOBR> immediately senses fear in the mind of a <NOBR>person-for</NOBR> reasons unknown, a bee will sting the person whose mind is releasing vibrations of fear, much more readily than it will molest the person whose mind registers no fear.</P>
<P class="p35 ft10">The vibrations of fear pass from one mind to another just as quickly and as surely as the sound of the human voice passes from the broadcasting station to the re- ceiving set of a <NOBR>radio-and</NOBR> BY THE <NOBR>SELF-SAME</NOBR> MEDIUM.</P>

<P class="p34 ft10">Mental telepathy is a reality. Thoughts pass from one mind to another, volun- tarily, whether or not this fact is recognized by either the person releasing the thoughts, or the persons who pick up those thoughts.</P>
<P class="p44 ft10">The person who gives expression, by word of mouth, to negative or destructive thoughts is practically certain to experience the results of those words in the form of a destructive <NOBR>“kick-back.”</NOBR> The release of destructive thought impulses, alone, without the aid of words, produces also a “kickback” in more ways than one. First of all, and perhaps most important to be remembered, the person who releases thoughts of a destructive nature, must suffer damage through the breaking down of the faculty of creative imagination.</P>
<P class="p44 ft10">Secondly, the presence in the mind of any destructive emotion develops a nega- tive personality which repels people, and often converts them into antagonists. The third source of damage to the person who entertains or releases negative thoughts, lies in this signiﬁcant <NOBR>fact-these</NOBR> <NOBR>thought-impulses</NOBR> are not only damag- ing to others, but they IMBED THEMSELVES IN THE SUBCONSCIOUS MIND OF THE PERSON RELEASING THEM, and there become a part of his charac- ter.</P>
<P class="p35 ft10">One is never through with a thought, merely by releasing it. When a thought is re- leased, it spreads in every direction, through the medium of the ether, but it also plants itself permanently in the subconscious mind of the person releasing it.</P>
<P class="p18 ft11">Your business in life is, presumably to achieve success. To be successful, you must ﬁnd peace of mind, acquire the material needs of life, and above all, attain HAP- PINESS. All of these evidences of success begin in the form of thought impulses.</P>
<P class="p17 ft10">You may control your own mind, you have the power to feed it whatever thought impulses you choose. With this privilege goes also the responsibility of using it constructively. You are the master of your own earthly destiny just as surely as you have the power to control your own thoughts. You may inﬂuence, direct, and eventually control your own environment, making your life what you want it to <NOBR>be-or,</NOBR> you may neglect to exercise the privilege which is yours, to make your life to order, thus casting yourself upon the broad sea of “Circumstance” where you will be tossed hither and yon, like a chip on the waves of the ocean.</P>

<P class="p8 ft16">THE DEVIL’S WORKSHOP: THE SEVENTH BASIC EVIL</P>
<P class="p22 ft11">In addition to the Six Basic Fears, there is another evil by which people suffer. It constitutes a rich soil in which the seeds of failure grow abundantly. It is so subtle that its presence often is not detected. This afﬂiction cannot properly be classed as a fear. IT IS MORE DEEPLY SEATED AND MORE OFTEN FATAL THAN ALL OF THE SIX FEARS. For want of a better name, let us call this evil SUSCEPTI-</P>
<P class="p108 ft8">BILITY TO NEGATIVE INFLUENCES.</P>
<P class="p20 ft10">Men who accumulate great riches always protect themselves against this evil! The poverty stricken never do! Those who succeed in any calling must prepare their minds to resist the evil. If you are reading this philosophy for the purpose of accumulating riches, you should examine yourself very carefully, to determine whether you are susceptible to negative inﬂuences. If you neglect this <NOBR>self-analy-</NOBR> sis, you will forfeit your right to attain the object of your desires.</P>
<P class="p38 ft11">Make the analysis searching. After you read the questions prepared for this self- analysis, hold yourself to a strict accounting in your answers. Go at the task as carefully as you would search for any other enemy you knew to be awaiting you in ambush and deal with your own faults as you would with a more tangible enemy. You can easily protect yourself against highway robbers, because the law provides organized cooperation for your beneﬁt, but the “seventh basic evil” is more difﬁ- cult to master, because it strikes when you are not aware of its presence, when you are asleep, and while you are awake. Moreover, its weapon is intangible, because it consists of <NOBR>merely-a</NOBR> STATE OF MIND. This evil is also dangerous because it strikes in as many different forms as there are human experiences. Sometimes it enters the mind through the <NOBR>well-meant</NOBR> words of one’s own relatives. At other times, it bores from within, through one’s own mental attitude. Always it is as deadly as poison, even though it may not kill as quickly.</P>
<P class="p234 ft16">HOW TO PROTECT YOURSELF AGAINST NEGATIVE INFLUENCES</P>
<P class="p20 ft10">To protect yourself against negative inﬂuences, whether of your own making, or the result of the activities of negative people around you, recognize that you have a <NOBR>WILL-POWER,</NOBR> and put it into constant use, until it builds a wall of immunity against negative inﬂuences in your own mind.</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">Recognize the fact that you, and every other human being, are, by nature, lazy, indifferent, and susceptible to all suggestions which harmonize with your weak- nesses.</P>

<P class="p40 ft8">You were given a <NOBR>WILL-POWER</NOBR> for this purpose.</P>
<P class="p33 ft10">Unfortunately, there is no legal protection against those who, either by design or ignorance, poison the minds of others by negative suggestion. This form of destruction should be punishable by heavy legal penalties, because it may and often does destroy one’s chances of acquiring material things which are protected by law. Men with negative minds tried to convince Thomas A. Edison that he could not build a machine that would record and reproduce the human voice, “because” they said, “no one else had ever produced such a machine.” Edison did not believe them. He knew that the mind could produce ANYTHING THE MIND COULD CONCEIVE AND BELIEVE, and that knowledge was the thing that lifted the great Edison above the common herd.</P>
<P class="p33 ft10">Men with negative minds told F. W. Woolworth, he would go “broke” trying to run a store on ﬁve and ten cent sales. He did not believe them. He knew that he could do anything, within reason, if he backed his plans with faith. Exercising his right to keep other men’s negative suggestions out of his mind, he piled up a fortune of more than a hundred million dollars.</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">Men with negative minds told George Washington he could not hope to win against the vastly superior forces of the British, but he exercised his Divine right to BELIEVE, therefore this book was published under the protection of the Stars and Stripes, while the name of Lord Cornwallis has been all but forgotten.</P>
<P class="p60 ft10">Doubting Thomases scoffed scornfully when Henry Ford tried out his ﬁrst crude- ly built automobile on the streets of Detroit. Some said the thing never would become practical. Others said no one would pay money for such a contraption.</P>
<P class="p13 ft12">FORD SAID, “I’LL BELT THE EARTH WITH DEPENDABLE MOTOR CARS,” AND HE DID!</P>
<P class="p38 ft11">His decision to trust his own judgment has already piled up a fortune far greater than the next ﬁve generations of his descendents can squander. For the beneﬁt of those seeking vast riches, let it be remembered that practically the sole difference between Henry Ford and a majority of the more than one hundred thousand men who work for him, is <NOBR>this-FORD</NOBR> HAS A MIND AND CONTROLS IT, THE OTH-</P>

<P class="p8 ft8">ERS HAVE MINDS WHICH THEY DO NOT TRY TO CONTROL.</P>
<P class="p33 ft10">Henry Ford has been repeatedly mentioned, because he is an astounding example of what a man with a mind of his own, and a will to control it, can accomplish. His record knocks the foundation from under that <NOBR>time-worn</NOBR> alibi, “I never had a chance.” Ford never had a chance, either, but he CREATED AN OPPORTUNITY AND BACKED IT WITH PERSISTENCE UNTIL IT MADE HIM RICHER THAN CROESUS.</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">Mind control is the result of <NOBR>self-discipline</NOBR> and habit. You either control your mind or it controls you. There is no <NOBR>hall-way</NOBR> compromise. The most practical of all methods for controlling the mind is the habit of keeping it busy with a deﬁnite purpose, backed by a deﬁnite plan. Study the record of any man who achieves noteworthy success, and you will observe that he has control over his own mind, moreover, that he exercises that control and directs it toward the attainment of deﬁnite objectives. Without this control, success is not possible.</P>
<P class="p253 ft16"><NOBR>“FIFTY-SEVEN”</NOBR> FAMOUS ALIBIS</P>
<P class="p254 ft16">By Old Man IF</P>
<P class="p33 ft10">People who do not succeed have one distinguishing trait in common. They know all the reasons for failure, and have what they believe to be <NOBR>air-tight</NOBR> alibis to ex- plain away their own lack of achievement.</P>
<P class="p12 ft10">Some of these alibis are clever, and a few of them are justiﬁable by the facts. But alibis cannot be used for money. The world wants to know only one <NOBR>thing-HAVE</NOBR> YOU ACHIEVED SUCCESS?</P>
<P class="p12 ft10">A character analyst compiled a list of the most commonly used alibis. As you read the list, examine yourself carefully, and determine how many of these alibis, if any, are your own property.</P>
<P class="p13 ft12">Remember, too, the philosophy presented in this book makes every one of these alibis obsolete.</P>

<P class="p33 ft10">IF - and this is the greatest of them all - I had the courage to see myself as I really am, I would ﬁnd out what is wrong with me, and correct it, then I might have a chance to proﬁt by my mistakes and learn something from the experience of oth- ers, for I know that there is something WRONG with me, or I would now be where I WOULD HAVE BEEN IF I had spent more time analyzing my weaknesses, and less time building alibis to cover them.</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">Building alibis with which to explain away failure is a national pastime. The habit is as old as the human race, and is fatal to success! Why do people cling to their pet alibis? The answer is obvious. They defend their alibis because THEY CRE- ATE them! A man’s alibi is the child of his own imagination. It is human nature to defend one’s own <NOBR>brain-child.</NOBR></P>
<P class="p13 ft10">Building alibis is a deeply rooted habit. Habits are difﬁcult to break, especially when they provide justiﬁcation for something we do. Plato had this truth in mind when he said, “The ﬁrst and best victory is to conquer self. To be conquered by self is, of all things, the most shameful and vile.”</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">Another philosopher had the same thought in mind when he said, “It was a great surprise to me when I discovered that most of the ugliness I saw in others, was but a reﬂection of my own nature.”</P>

<P class="p19 ft10">“It has always been a mystery to me,” said Elbert Hubbard, “why people spend so much time deliberately fooling themselves by creating alibis to cover their weak- nesses. If used differently, this same time would be sufﬁcient to cure the weak- ness, then no alibis would be needed.”</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">In parting, I would remind you that “Life is a checkerboard, and the player op- posite you is TIME. If you hesitate before moving, or neglect to move promptly, your men will be wiped off the board by TIME. You are playing against a partner who will not tolerate INDECISION!”</P>
<P class="p13 ft10">Previously you may have had a logical excuse for not having forced Life to come through with whatever you asked, but that alibi is now obsolete, because you are in possession of the Master Key that unlocks the door to Life’s bountiful riches.</P>
<P class="p12 ft10">The Master Key is intangible, but it is powerful! It is the privilege of creating, in your own mind, a BURNING DESIRE for a deﬁnite form of riches. There is no penalty for the use of the Key, but there is a price you must pay if you do not use it. The price is FAILURE. There is a reward of stupendous proportions if you put the Key to use. It is the satisfaction that comes to all who conquer self and force Life to pay whatever is asked.</P>
<P class="p46 ft8">The reward is worthy of your effort. Will you make the start and be convinced?</P>
<P class="p96 ft8">“If we are related,” said the immortal Emerson, “we shall meet.”</P>
<P class="p33 ft12">In closing, may I borrow his thought, and say, “If we are related, we have, through these pages, met.”</P>
